GENERAL SAFETY 
26.1 
Official instructions will be given to drivers by means of the signals laid out in the Code. 
Competitors must not use flags or lights similar to these. In accordance with Appendix H of the 
Code, the light signals displayed on the trackside light panels have the same meaning as flag 
signals. In accordance with and supplementary to Article 2.5.5b of Appendix H of the Code: 
a) 
Single Waved Yellow Flag: Any driver passing through a waved yellow flag marshalling 
sector must reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction. In order for the 
stewards to be satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requirements they 
are expected to have braked earlier and/or discernibly reduced speed in the relevant 
marshalling sector. 
b) 
Double Waved Yellow Flag: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag 
marshalling sector must reduce speed significantly and be prepared to change direction 
or stop. In order for the stewards to be satisfied that any such driver has complied with 
these requirements it must be clear that the driver has not attempted to set a meaningful 
lap time on the relevant lap. Furthermore, during a sprint qualifying or qualifying session, 
any driver passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector will have that 
lap time deleted. 
c) 
Double Waved Yellow Flag during a Safety Car or Virtual Safety Car Period: Any driver 
passing through a double waved yellow flag marshalling sector during a safety car or 
virtual safety car period, in addition to the requirements of b), must stay above the 
minimum time set by the FIA ECU in each marshalling sector concerned.  
26.2 
Save where these Sporting Regulations require otherwise, pit lane and track discipline and safety 
measures will be the same for all free practice sessions, the qualifying session, the sprint 
qualifying session and sprint session as for the race. 
26.3 
Other than by driving on the track, Competitors are not permitted to attempt to alter the grip 
of any part of the track surface. 
26.4 
If a car stops on the track, it shall be the duty of the marshals to remove it as quickly as possible 
so that its presence does not constitute a danger or hinder other Competitors. Under no 
circumstances may a driver stop his car on the track without justifiable reason. 
26.5 
A driver who abandons a car must leave it in neutral or with the clutch disengaged, with the ERS 
shut down and with the steering wheel in place. 
26.6 
Save as specifically authorised by the Code or these Sporting Regulations, no one except the 
driver may touch a stopped car unless it is in the paddock, the Competitors’ designated garage 
area, the pit lane or on the starting grid. 
26.7 
During the period commencing fifteen (15) minutes prior to and ending five (5) minutes after 
every free practice session, qualifying session and sprint qualifying session and the period 
between the commencement of the formation lap which immediately precedes the sprint 
session and the race and the time when the last car enters the parc fermé, no one is allowed on 
the track, the pit entry road or the pit exit road with the exception of: 
 
a) 
Marshals or other authorised personnel in the execution of their duty. 
 
b) 
Drivers when driving or on foot, having first received permission to do so from a marshal."
29," 
 
 
c) 
Team personnel when either pushing a car or clearing equipment from the grid after all 
cars able to do so have left the grid on the formation lap. 
 
d) 
Team personnel when assisting marshals to remove a car from the grid after the start of 
the sprint session or the race. 
26.8 
During a sprint session and a race, the engine may only be started with the starter except in the 
pit lane or the Competitors’ designated garage area where the use of an external starting device 
is allowed. 
26.9 
Drivers taking part in any free practice session, qualifying session, sprint qualifying session, 
sprint session or the race must always wear flame-resistant clothing, helmets, and Frontal Head 
Restraints (FHR) specified in the Code. 
26.10 Any driver whose car has significant and obvious damage to a structural component which 
results in it being in a condition presenting an immediate risk of endangering the driver or 
others, or whose car has a significant failure or fault which means it cannot reasonably return 
to the pit lane without unnecessarily impeding another competitor or otherwise hindering the 
Competition must leave the track as soon as it is safe to do so. 
 At the sole discretion of the Race Director, should a car be deemed to have such significant and 
obvious damage to a structural component, or such significant failure or fault, the Competitor 
may be instructed that the car must leave the track as soon as it is safe to do so. 
26.11 The lights described in Article 14.3 of the Technical Regulations must be illuminated at all times 
when using intermediate or wet-weather tyres. All lights must be in working order when the car 
leaves the pit lane for the first time for any free practice session, qualifying session, sprint 
qualifying session, sprint session, or race. It shall be at the discretion of the Race Director to 
decide whether or not a driver should be stopped if the central rear light described in Article 
14.3.2 of the Technical Regulations and at least one of the side lights described in Article 14.3.3 
of the Technical Regulations are not working. Should a car be stopped in this way the driver may 
re-join when the fault has been remedied. 
26.12 Only twelve (12) team members for each Competitor are permitted in the signalling area during 
any free practice session, qualifying session, sprint qualifying session, sprint session and the 
race. 
26.13 Unless authorised by the FIA no one under the age of 16 is permitted in the pit lane at the 
following times: 
a) 
The period commencing fifteen (15) minutes prior to and ending five (5) minutes after 
every free practice session, the qualifying session, and the sprint qualifying session.  
b) 
The period commencing fifteen (15) minutes before the pit exit is opened to allow cars to 
cover reconnaissance laps and the time when the last car enters the parc fermé after the 
sprint session or the race has ended. 
26.14 The Race Director, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) or the Medical Delegate can require a driver 
to have a medical examination at any time during a Competition. 
If, after an incident, the Impact Warning Light is activated the driver may, at the discretion of 
the Race Director, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) or the Medical Delegate, be required to be 
examined by the Competition medical service without delay. The Medical Delegate will 
determine the most appropriate time and place for this examination. 
26.15 The organiser must make at least two (2) fire extinguishers of 5kg capacity available to each 
Competitor and ensure that they work properly."
30," 
 
26.16 Animals, except those which may have been expressly authorised by the FIA for use by security 
services, are forbidden on the track, in the pit lane, in the paddock or in any spectator area. 
26.17 Other than where permitted in Articles 57 and 58, tyre blankets are not permitted in the Pit Lane 
at any time during the sprint session or the race and must be removed before the tyres are 
carried to the pit stop area. 
26.18  Except during a sprint session suspension or race suspension, any car abandoned on the circuit 
by its driver, even temporarily, shall be considered as withdrawn from the session. In exceptional 
circumstances, cars abandoned on the circuit during a sprint session suspension or race 
suspension may be allowed to participate when that session resumes, provided they were not 
abandoned because of a mechanical issue, car damage or in order to gain an advantage. 
26.19  If the Official Weather Service predicts that the Heat Index will be greater than 31.0°C at some 
time during the sprint session or the race at a Competition, or at the sole discretion of the Race 
Director, a Heat Hazard may be declared twenty-four (24) hours prior to the scheduled start of 
the Competition. Once a Heat Hazard is declared it shall remain in force for the Competition. All 
competitors will be notified via the official messaging system. Once a Heat Hazard is declared:  
a)  
All components of the Driver Cooling System, with the exception of any cooling medium 
and any items of a driver’s personal equipment that form part of the system must be 
fitted. 
b)  
At the start of any sprint session or race for which a Heat Hazard has been declared, all 
components of the Driver Cooling System must be fitted. The system must be functional 
and available for use by the driver, meeting the specific provisions provided in Article 
14.6.1 of the Technical Regulations for these sessions. 
However, any driver may elect not to wear any items of personal equipment that form 
part of the driver cooling system. In such circumstance, all other components, including 
any cooling medium, of the Driver Cooling System must be fitted. In addition, the 
difference in mass between the driver’s personal equipment normally used and any items 
of a driver’s personal equipment that form part of the system must be compensated by 
the fitting of 0.5kg of ballast in the cockpit, such ballast designated for this purpose will 
be included in sum of masses described in Article 4.7b of the Technical Regulations. 
c)  
In accordance with Articles 4.1 and 4.7 of the Technical Regulations the Heat Hazard Mass 
Increases shall apply. 
 
27) 
SPARE CARS 
27.1 
Each Competitor may have no more than two (2) cars available for use at any one time during a 
Competition, except when all the following circumstances are met: 
a) 
A car has suffered genuine accident damage, as specified in Article 40.2 g) or has suffered 
a significant failure or fault as demonstrated to the Technical Delegate, accepted by the 
Technical Delegate as necessitating a change of survival cell. 
b) 
The Competitor has provided a written request to the FIA to change the survival cell, and 
this has been approved by the Technical Delegate. 
c) 
There are no more than two cars available for one driver at any one time, and this period 
is only sufficient to facilitate the change of car. 
27.2 
In the context of this article, a car is defined as an assembly consisting of: 
• 
a survival cell,"
31," 
 
• 
with a Power Unit or components of a Power Unit installed or partially installed. A Power 
Unit is as defined in Article 5.1.2 and Appendix 3 column three (titled ‘Art.5.1.2 Defin.’) of 
the Technical Regulations, 
• 
and any other car components fitted or installed. 
 
28) 
POWER UNIT USAGE 
28.1 
The only power unit that may be used at a Competition during the 2022-2025 Championship 
seasons is a power unit which is constituted only of elements that were in conformity, at the 
date they were introduced in the race pool, with the latest submitted and approved 
homologation dossier as defined in Appendix 4 of the Technical Regulations. 
28.2 
Unless a driver drives for more than one (1) Competitor (see Article 28.4 below), and subject to 
the additions described below, each driver may use no more than four (4) engines (ICE), four (4) 
motor generator units-heat (MGU-H), four (4) turbochargers (TC), two (2) energy stores (ES), 
two (2) control electronics (CE), four (4) motor generator units-kinetic (MGU-K) and eight (8) of 
each of the four (4) elements constituting a set of Engine exhaust systems during a 
Championship. For the purpose of this article a set of Engine exhaust systems is deemed to 
comprise the following four (4) elements: primaries LHS, primaries RHS, secondary LHS and 
secondary RHS. 
28.3 
Should a driver use more Power Unit elements than the numbers prescribed in Article 28.2 of 
any one of the elements during a Championship, a grid place penalty for the race will be imposed 
upon him at the first Competition during which each additional element is used. Penalties will 
be applied according to the following table and will be cumulative: 
a) 
The first time an additional element of each type is used: Ten (10) grid place penalty for 
the race. 
b) 
The next times an additional element of each type is used: Five (5) grid place penalty for 
the race. 
Any of the seven (7) elements will be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing 
transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane. 
During any single Competition, if a driver introduces more than one of the same Power Unit 
element which is subject to penalties, only the last element fitted may be used at subsequent 
Competitions without further penalty. 
28.4 
If a driver is replaced at any time during the Championship his replacement will be deemed to 
be the original driver for the purposes of assessing Power Unit usage. 
28.5 
After consultation with the relevant Power Unit Manufacturer the FIA will attach seals to each 
of the relevant elements of the Power Unit prior to them being used for the first time at a 
Competition in order to ensure that no significant parts can be rebuilt or replaced. Exhaust 
elements defined in Article 28.2 above should be permanently and uniquely marked, which is 
then clearly visible directly or using an optical device in a timely manner when a Power Unit is 
fitted to a chassis. 
Within two (2) hours of the end of the post-race Parc Fermé additional seals will be applied to 
all used power unit elements in order to ensure that they cannot be run or dismantled between 
Competitions. The sealing method must be agreed with the Technical Delegate. 
Upon request to the FIA, these additional seals will be removed twenty-four (24) hours before 
the scheduled start of P1 at the next Competition at which the Power Unit elements are 
required. All such Power Unit elements must remain within the Competitor’s designated garage"
32," 
 
area when not fitted to a car and may not be started at any time during a Competition other 
than when fitted to a car eligible to participate in the Competition. 
If any of the FIA seals are damaged or removed from the relevant components within the Power 
Unit after they have been used for the first time those parts may not be used again unless they 
were removed under FIA supervision.

The only sets of tyres which may be used during a Competition are those which are 
defined in Article 30.2a). 
 
Any driver who uses a set of tyres of differing specifications or tyres not allocated to him 
during the sprint session or the race may not cross the Line on the track more than twice 
before returning to the pits and changing them for a set of tyres of the same specification. 
A penalty under Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who does not change tyres 
as specified above. For the avoidance of doubt, a set of tyres of differing specifications 
will not be considered when assessing the number of specifications used during the race. 
 
c) 
Tyres fitted in the pit lane will be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing 
transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane with these tyres fitted. Tyres fitted on"

weather tyres during the race, each driver must use at least two (2) different 
specifications of dry-weather tyres during the race, at least one (1) of which must be a 
mandatory dry-weather race tyre specification as defined in Article 30.2c)ii). 
For the race in Monaco, each driver must use at least three (3) sets of tyres of any 
specification described in Article 30.1a)i) during the race and, unless they have used 
intermediate or wet-weather tyres during the race, each driver must use at least two (2) 
different specifications of dry-weather tyres during the race, at least one (1) of which must 
be a mandatory dry-weather race tyre specification as defined in Article 30.2c)ii). 
 
 
Unless the race is suspended and cannot be re-started, failure to comply with these 
requirements will result in the disqualification of the relevant driver from the race results. 
For all races except the race in Monaco, if the race is suspended and cannot be re-started, 
thirty (30) seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who did not, when 
required to do so, use at least two (2) specifications of dry-weather tyre during the race. 
For the race in Monaco, if the race is suspended and cannot be re-started, thirty (30) 
seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who did not, when required to do 
so, use at least two (2) specifications of dry-weather tyre during the race, or who did not 
use at least three (3) sets of tyres of any specification during the race. Furthermore, an 
additional thirty (30) seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who used 
only one (1) set of tyres of any specification during the race.

If the formation lap is started behind the safety car in accordance with Article 49.1a, or 
the sprint session or race is resumed in accordance with Article 58.1, the use of wet-
weather tyres until the safety car orange lights are extinguished and it returns to the pit 
lane is compulsory. A penalty under Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver whose 
tyre(s) are changed for a different specification or who uses any other specification of 
tyres whilst the safety car is on the track at such times. 
 
o) 
If additional specifications of dry-weather tyres are made available in accordance with 
Article 30.1a)iii), these tyres will be allocated to each Driver for use during P2. If P2 is 
unsuitable for the evaluation of these tyres (such as due to poor weather) they will not 
be made available to each Driver and they may be carried over to the back-up 
Competition, as advised by the FIA. Unless the additional tyres have not been made 
available, or the session is declared wet, all Drivers will have to use them during P2, 
according to run plans specified by the appointed tyre supplier with the same number of 
laps per Driver, and the only dry weather tyres that may be used are those allocated under 
Article 30.1a)iii). 
i)

specification, configuration and set-up. Mechanical set-up changes, driver control 
changes, software and component changes are only permitted if they are necessary 
for the correct evaluation of the tyres or to complete the tyre test. Set-up changes 
and driver control changes must be agreed in advance with the tyre supplier. 
Component and software changes must be approved by the FIA. A replacement 
component may be approved in cases such as damage to the original and should 
be of the same specification. Exceptionally, if a same specification component is 
unavailable, a component of a different specification which has been previously 
used at a Competition or TCC may be approved. 
iii) 
Additional sensors and logging 
Additional sensors may be fitted on the car to measure tyre state and or 
performance and must be agreed with the appointed tyre supplier and the FIA in 
advance. Data collected from such sensors must be shared with the appointed tyre 
supplier in due time after the test session, and processed data from such sensors 
(having removed any team-specific information) may be shared by the appointed 
tyre supplier with the other Competitors. 
iv) 
All additional tyres allocated in accordance with Article 30.1a)iii) must be 
electronically returned no later than two (2) hours after the end of P2.

tyre rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag. 
 
c) 
Tyres may be used on a test rig providing forces control and monitoring by Formula One 
rim manufacturers for the sole purpose of proof testing their products. 
30.7 
Irrespective of the provisions of Articles 30.5o), if a Driver is unable to participate in P1 because 
he has been replaced with a Driver under the provisions of Article 32.4c), the Driver not 
participating in P1 may use tyres other than those allocated under Article 30.1a)iii) after 60 
minutes of the P2 session has elapsed. This exception is permitted on one occasion only for each 
Competitor during the Championship. 
a) 
The driver must comply with the provisions of Article 30.5o)i). 
b)

times. 
33.3 
Drivers must make every reasonable effort to use the track at all times and may not leave the 
track without a justifiable reason. 
 
Drivers will be judged to have left the track if no part of the car remains in contact with it and, 
for the avoidance of doubt, any white lines defining the track edges are considered to be part of 
the track but the kerbs are not. 
 
Should a car leave the track the driver may re-join, however, this may only be done when it is 
safe to do so and without gaining any lasting advantage. At the absolute discretion of the Race 
Director a driver may be given the opportunity to give back the whole of any advantage he 
gained by leaving the track. 
33.4 
At no time may a car be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be 
deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person.

PIT ENTRY ROAD, PIT LANE AND PIT EXIT ROAD 
34.1 
Unless otherwise defined by the Race Director, the section of track leading to the pit lane, 
between the first safety car line and the beginning of the pit lane, will be designated the “pit 
entry road”. 
34.2 
Unless otherwise defined by the Race Director, the section of track from the end of the pit lane 
leading to the track, between the end of the pit lane and the second safety car line, will be 
designated the “pit exit road”. 
34.3 
At no time may a car be reversed in the pit lane under its own power. 
34.4 
The pit lane will be divided into two lanes, the lane closest to the pit wall will be designated the 
“fast lane” and may be no more than 3.5 metres wide, the lane closest to the garages will be 
designated the “inner lane”. 
 
Other than when cars are at the end of the pit lane in accordance with Articles 43.3. 44.2 and 
57, the inner lane is the only area where any work can be carried out on a car. However, no work 
may be carried out in the fast lane if it is likely to hinder other cars attempting to leave the pit 
lane. 
34.5 
The FIA will allocate garages and an area in the pit lane on an equal basis where each Competitor 
may work and, within each of these designated garage areas, one position where pit stops 
during any free practice session, qualifying session, sprint qualifying session, sprint session or 
the race may be carried out. For safety reasons, no car should be driven from its pit stop position 
at any time unless: 
a) 
It has first been driven into the pit stop position having just entered the pit lane from the 
track; and 
b) 
It is then driven immediately back onto the track from the pit stop position. 
34.6 
No powered device may be used to lift any part of a car in the pit lane. 
34.7

this limit may be amended by the Race Director following a recommendation from the Safety 
Delegate."
43," 
 
a) 
Any Competitor whose driver exceeds the limit during any free practice session, qualifying 
session, or sprint qualifying session will be fined €100 for each km/h above the limit, up 
to a maximum of €1000. 
b) 
In accordance with Article 18.1 the stewards may impose an additional penalty if they 
suspect a driver was speeding in order to gain any sort of advantage. 
c) 
During a sprint session or the race, the stewards may impose any of the penalties under 
Article 54.3a), 54.3b), 54.3c) or 54.3d) on any driver who exceeds the limit. 
34.8 
Unless a car is pushed from the grid at any time during the start procedure, cars may only be 
driven from the Competitors’ designated garage area to the end of the pit lane. 
 
Any car(s) driven to the end of the pit lane prior to the start or re-start of a free practice session, 
qualifying session or sprint qualifying session must form up in a line in the fast lane and leave in 
the order they got there unless another car is unduly delayed. 
34.9 
With the exception of the reconnaissance laps permitted by Articles 43.2 and 44.1, any driver 
that is required to start the sprint session or the race from the pit lane may not drive his car 
from his Competitors designated garage area until the pit lane exit is closed before the 
scheduled start of the formation lap in accordance with Articles 43.3 or 44.2 and must stop in a 
line in the fast lane. 
 
Under these circumstances working in the fast lane will be permitted for a period ending fifteen 
(15) seconds prior to the commencement of the Formation lap, after which all personnel and

parts may be added, removed, or replaced. 
 
At all times drivers must follow the directions of the marshals. 
34.10 Other than by drying or sweeping, or by laying tyre rubber when cars leave their pit stop 
position, Competitors may not attempt to enhance the grip of the surface in the pit lane unless 
a problem has been clearly identified and a solution agreed to by the Safety Delegate. 
34.11 Competitors must not paint lines on any part of the pit lane. 
34.12 Other than when detailed in Article 34.9, no equipment may be left in the fast lane. 
34.13 Team personnel are only allowed in the pit lane immediately before they are required to work 
on a car and must withdraw as soon as the work is complete. 
 
All team personnel carrying out any work on a car in the pit lane when the car is in its pit stop 
position for the purpose of adjusting or replacing components, or serving a penalty during the 
qualifying session, the sprint qualifying session, the sprint session or the race, must be wearing 
helmets which meet or exceed the requirements of ECE 22.05 – European motorcycle road 
helmet, DOT – USA motorcycle road helmet or JIS T8133-2015, class 2 – JPN protective helmets 
for automobile users. The use of appropriate eye protection is compulsory. 
34.14 In all of the cases detailed in this Article 34.14, a car will be deemed to have been released either 
when it has been driven out of its designated garage area (when leaving from the garage) or 
after it has completely cleared its pit stop position following a pit stop."
44," 
 
a) 
Cars must not be released from a garage or pit stop position in way that could endanger 
pit lane personnel or another driver, or that is likely to cause damage to another car. 
b) 
Competitors must provide a means of clearly establishing, when being viewed from both 
above and in the front of the car, when a car was released. 
c) 
If a car is deemed to have been released in an unsafe condition during any free practice, 
or qualifying session or sprint qualifying session, the stewards may drop the driver such 
number of grid positions as they consider appropriate. Such penalty will be applied to the 
race unless the infringement has been committed during the sprint qualifying session, in 
which case the penalty will be applied to the sprint session. 
d) 
If a car is deemed to have been released in an unsafe condition during a sprint session or 
a race, a penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on the driver 
concerned. However, if the driver retires from the sprint session or the race as a result of 
the car being released in an unsafe condition a fine may be imposed upon the Competitor. 
e) 
An additional penalty will be imposed on any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, 
continues to drive a car knowing it to have been released in an unsafe condition. 
34.15 In exceptional circumstances the Race Director may ask for the pit entry to be closed during the 
sprint session or the race for safety reasons.  
a) 
At such times drivers may only enter the pit lane in order for essential and entirely evident 
repairs to be carried out to the car.  
b) 
A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who, in the 
opinion of the stewards, entered the pit lane for any other reason whilst it was closed. 
 
35) 
WEIGHING 
35.1 
After any free practice session or during the qualifying session or during the sprint qualifying 
session cars will be weighed as follows: 
a) 
When signalled to do so the driver will proceed directly to the FIA garage and stop his 
engine. 
b) 
Any driver who fails to stop when asked to do so, and then fails to bring the car back to 
the FIA garage, or if work is carried out on the car before it is returned to the FIA garage, 
will be referred to the stewards. 
c) 
Each driver must be weighed by the Technical Delegate at the end of the last part of the 
qualifying session or sprint qualifying session in which they participated. 
d) 
At the end of the qualifying session or the sprint qualifying session all cars which took part 
in Q3 (or SQ3) will be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed, he 
must ask the Technical Delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to 
that of the car. 
e) 
If a car stops on the circuit during the qualifying session or the sprint qualifying session 
and the driver leaves the car, he must go to the FIA garage immediately on his return to 
the pit lane in order for his weight to be established. 
35.2 
After the sprint session or the race any classified car may be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave 
his car before it is weighed, he must ask the Technical Delegate to weigh him in order that this 
weight may be added to that of the car. 
35.3 
The relevant car may be disqualified should its weight be less than that specified in Article 4.1 
of the Technical Regulations when weighed in accordance with Articles 35.1 or 35.2, save where 
the deficiency in weight results from the accidental loss of a component of the car."
45," 
 
35.4 
No substance may be added to, placed on, or removed from a car after it has been selected for 
weighing or has finished the sprint session or the race or during the weighing procedure. (Except 
by a scrutineer when acting in his official capacity). 
35.5 
In the event of any breach of these provisions for the weighing of cars the stewards may drop 
the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate or disqualify him from the 
sprint session or the race.

37.1 
No driver may start a sprint session or the race without taking part in at least one (1) practice 
session. 
37.2 
During all practice sessions there will be a green and a red light at the end of the pit lane. Cars 
may only leave the pit lane when the green light is on. Additionally, a blue flag and/or a flashing 
blue light will be shown in the pit exit road to warn drivers leaving the pit lane if cars are 
approaching on the track. 
37.3 
Unless written permission has been given by the FIA to do otherwise, the circuit may only be 
used for purposes other than the Competition after the last practice session on each day of 
practice, after the sprint session (where it is scheduled), and on the day of the race no less than 
one (1) hour before the end of the pit lane is opened to allow cars to cover a reconnaissance 
lap. 
37.4 
In the event of a driving infringement during any free practice session, qualifying session or the 
sprint qualifying session the Stewards may delete a driver’s lap time (or lap times) or drop the 
driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate.  
a) 
Unless it is completely clear that a driver committed a driving infringement any such 
incident will normally be investigated after the relevant session."

occurred in the sprint qualifying session, in which case such penalty will be applied to the 
grid of the sprint session. 
c) 
Where appropriate, regard will also be given to the provisions of Article 18.1. 
37.5 
Any driver taking part in any free practice session, the qualifying session or the sprint qualifying 
session who, in the opinion of the stewards, stops unnecessarily on the circuit or unnecessarily 
impedes another driver shall be subject to the penalties referred to in Article 37.4. 
37.6 
Should it become necessary to stop any free practice session, the qualifying session or the sprint 
qualifying session because the circuit is blocked by an accident or because weather or other 
conditions make it dangerous to continue, the clerk of the course will order red flags to be shown 
at all marshal posts and the orange abort lights on the start gantry to be illuminated shown at 
the Line. 
a) 
When the signal is given to stop all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed 
slowly back to the pit lane. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from 
the time at which the “RED FLAG” message appears on the official messaging system until 
the time that each car crosses the first safety car line when entering the pit lane, drivers 
must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling 
sector (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light 
panels). 
b) 
All cars abandoned on the track will be removed to a safe place. 
c) 
At the end of each free practice session, any period of the qualifying session (Q1, Q2, Q3) 
or any period of the sprint qualifying session (SQ1, SQ2, SQ3) no driver may cross the Line 
more than once. 
37.7 
The clerk of the course may interrupt practice as often and for as long as he thinks necessary to 
clear the track or to allow the recovery of a car. However, only during the qualifying session or 
the sprint qualifying session will the session be extended as a result. 
a) 
Should one or more sessions be thus interrupted, no protest can be accepted as to the 
possible effects of the interruption on the qualification of drivers admitted to start the 
race or the sprint session.

P2 will be increased in duration to last one and a half (1.5) hours. In such instances the 
free practice session P3 will start no less than seventeen and a half (17.5) hours after the 
end of P2. 
38.3 
After the end of each free practice session, as defined in Articles 38.1 and 38.2, any driver on 
track when the end-of-session signal is shown may carry out a practice start on the grid. Any 
such driver wishing to perform a practice start must: 
a) 
Cross the Line following the end-of-session signal being shown, complete one (1) further 
lap and proceed to the grid. 
b) 
Perform the start from a marked grid position, pulling as far forward on the grid as 
possible.  
c) 
Under no circumstances perform a practice start if another car remains stationary in front 
of them on the same side of the grid. 
If the Race Director considers it is necessary to stop the conduct of practice starts, a red flag will 
be displayed, and the orange abort lights on the start gantry will be illuminated shown at the 
Line. In the event of a red flag any driver remaining on the grid must move away slowly and all 
cars remaining on track must proceed slowly into the pit lane.

c) 
After a seven (7) minute break the session will resume for eight 8 minutes (SQ3) and the 
ten (10) remaining cars will be permitted on the track. 
39.4 
The qualifying session or sprint qualifying session Classification under Articles 39.2 and 39.3 will 
be determined in the following way: 
a)  
Classified drivers will be ordered according to the sequence below: 
i) 
The top ten positions will be allocated to the drivers who took part in Q3 or SQ3, in 
accordance with the best time set by each driver in Q3 or SQ3, the fastest in the 
first position. 
ii) 
The next five positions will be allocated to the drivers who got eliminated in Q2 or 
SQ2, in accordance with the best time set by each driver in Q2 or SQ2, the fastest 
in the 11th position. 
iii) 
The next five positions will be allocated to the drivers who got eliminated in Q1 or 
SQ1, in accordance with the best time set by each driver, the fastest in the 16th 
position. 
iv) 
If two (2) or more drivers set identical times during Q1, Q2 or Q3 or SQ1, SQ2 or 
SQ3 priority will be given to the one who set it first. 
v) 
If more than one driver fails to set a time during Q2 or Q3, or SQ2 or SQ3, they will 
be arranged in the following order: 
- 
Any driver who attempted to set a qualifying time by starting a flying lap. 
- 
Any driver who failed to start a flying lap. 
- 
Any driver who failed to leave the pits during the period."
49," 
 
The  relative classification of drivers in each of the categories described above shall 
be determined in accordance with the order they were classified in the previous 
period of the relevant qualifying, or sprint qualifying, session. 
b) 
Drivers will be considered to be “unclassified” in the following circumstances: 
i) 
If they got eliminated in Q1 or SQ1 and their best session lap exceeded 107% of the 
fastest time set during that session, unless the track was declared wet by the Race 
Director. 
ii) 
If they failed to set a time in Q1 or SQ1, or if all their laps were deleted 
iii) 
If they got disqualified by the Stewards from the Qualifying session or sprint 
qualifying session 
The relative classification of such drivers will be determined as follows: 
- 
Drivers who are unclassified because of conditions (i) or (ii) will be allocated 
the top positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 (or, 
in the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1) 
- 
Drivers who are unclassified because of condition (iii) will be allocated the 
lower positions in accordance with the order they were classified in P3 (or, in 
the case a Sprint Session is scheduled, P1) 
The participation of unclassified drivers in the remainder of the Competition will be 
determined in each case by the Stewards, who may exceptionally consider parameters 
such as: 
- 
A suitable lap time being set in another practice session 
- 
The general performance of the driver in previous Competitions of the 
Championship 
- 
The gravity of the offence which caused the driver’s disqualification 
39.5 
The procedure detailed in Article 39.2 and 39.3 is based upon twenty (20) cars being officially 
eligible to take part in the Competition. If twenty-two (22) cars are eligible six (6) will be 
eliminated after Q1, Q2, SQ1 and SQ2, if twenty-four (24) cars are eligible seven (7) cars will be 
eliminated after Q1, Q2, SQ1 and SQ2, and so on if more cars are eligible. 
39.6 
Any driver whose car stops in any area other than the Pit Lane during the qualifying session or 
the sprint qualifying session and receives physical assistance will not be permitted to take any 
further part in that session. 
39.7 
At the end of the qualifying session or sprint qualifying session the times achieved by each driver 
will be officially published. 
39.8 
An AOT, as defined in Technical Regulations, must be empty during the complete qualifying 
session or sprint qualifying session.

the same in design and similar in mass, inertia, and function to the original car. The set-
up of the suspension must be the same. 
k)  
Work required by the Technical Delegate. 
40.3 
Any parts which are removed from the car in order to carry out any work specifically permitted 
in Article 40.2, or any parts removed to carry out essential safety checks, must remain close to 
the car and, at all times, be visible to the scrutineer assigned to the relevant car. Furthermore, 
any parts removed from the car in order to carry out any such work must be refitted before the 
car leaves the pit lane. 
Any work not listed in Article 40.2 may only be undertaken with the approval of the Technical 
Delegate following a written request from the Competitor concerned. It must be clear that any 
replacement part a Competitor wishes to fit is the same in design and similar in mass, inertia 
and function to the original. Any parts which are removed shall be retained by the FIA.  
If a Competitor wishes to change a part during the sprint qualifying session, qualifying session, 
on the grid before the start of the sprint session and between reconnaissance laps and / or on 
the grid before the start of the race, this may be done without first seeking the permission of 
the Technical Delegate, provided it is reasonable for the relevant Competitor to believe 
permission would be given if there was time to ask and the broken or damaged part remains in 
full view of the scrutineer assigned to the car at all times.  
40.4 
Exceptionally, at each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled, requests made under 
40.3 for replacement parts that are different in design will be considered for approval where the 
Competitor can demonstrate there is a shortage of parts, and provided that the replacement 
part is of a specification that has been previously used in a sprint qualifying session, a sprint 
session, a qualifying session or a race. In such cases, the Competitor must inform the FIA in 
writing prior to the start of the sprint session of any parts where this may be necessary.   
40.5 
At the end of each sprint qualifying and qualifying session the FIA will select specific cars to 
undergo further checks. Once informed their car has been selected the Competitor concerned 
must take the car to the Parc Fermé immediately. 
40.6 
Within two (2) hours of the end of both the sprint qualifying (where it is scheduled) and the 
qualifying session all cars used during each session (or which were intended for use but failed to 
leave the pit lane) must be covered and ready for FIA seals to be applied. For marketing purposes 
this deadline may be extended for one car from each Competitor for a maximum of two (2) 
hours by prior arrangement with the Technical Delegate. Whilst cars are covered overnight, they 
may be fitted with devices to keep them warm. In the case of a breach of this Article, it will also 
be considered that the Competitor has breached Article 40.9. The relevant driver will be 
penalised by a single penalty for the combination of both offences. 
40.7 
At each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled, three (3) hours before the scheduled 
start of the formation lap for the sprint, the seals and covers may be removed but the cars will 
remain under parc fermé conditions until the start of the sprint. 
40.8 
Five (5) hours before the scheduled start of the formation lap for the race, the seals and covers 
may be removed but the cars will remain under parc fermé conditions until the start of the race."
53," 
 
40.9 
A Competitor may not modify any part on the car or make changes to the set-up of the 
suspension whilst the car is being held under parc fermé conditions. In the case of a breach of 
this Article: 
a) 
At each Competition where a sprint session is not scheduled, the relevant driver must 
start the race from the pit lane and follow the procedures prescribed in Article 44.2. 
b) 
At each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled, if the parc fermé conditions are 
breached before the start of the sprint session, the relevant driver must start the sprint 
session from the pit lane and follow the procedures prescribed in Article 43.3. If the parc 
fermé conditions are breached after the start of the qualifying session the relevant driver 
must start the race from the pit lane and follow the procedures prescribed in Article 44.2. 
 
In order that the scrutineers may be completely satisfied that no alterations have been made to 
the suspension systems or aerodynamic configuration of the car (with the exception of the front 
wing) whilst in pre-race parc fermé, it must be clear from physical inspection that changes 
cannot be made without the use of tools. 
40.10 One (1) scrutineer will be allocated to each car for the purpose of ensuring that no unauthorised 
work is carried out whilst cars are being held under parc fermé conditions. 
40.11 A list of parts replaced with the specific agreement of the Technical Delegate whilst cars are 
being held under parc fermé conditions will be published and distributed to all Competitors prior 
to the race. 
40.12 The mass of oil contained in each oil tank, with the exception of the main oil tank, must be 
declared to the FIA one (1) hour before the scheduled start of the race.

THE GRID FOR THE SPRINT OR THE RACE  
42.1 
The grid for the race will be formed in accordance with the results of the qualifying session 
described in Article 39.2, the classification process defined in Article 39.4 and the procedure 
defined in Article 42.3. Any penalties received for the race will be added up and be applied using 
the procedure defined in Article 42.3. 
In the exceptional circumstance that the qualifying session does not take place at a Competition, 
and with acceptance of the Stewards that the session cannot take place, the grid for the race 
will be defined based upon the Drivers’ Championship classification. In such circumstance, the 
procedure defined in Article 42.3 shall be applied using the Drivers’ Championship classification 
of each driver instead of their qualifying session classification, all drivers shall be considered to 
be classified. 
If neither of the methods of forming the grid for the race described above can be applied, the 
formation of the grid for the race shall be at the sole discretion of the Stewards. 
42.2 
The grid for the sprint session, if scheduled, will be formed in accordance with the results of the 
sprint qualifying session described in Article 39.3, the classification process defined in Article 
39.4 and the procedure defined in Article 42.3. Any penalties received for the sprint session will 
be added up and be applied using the procedure defined in Article 42.3. 
In the exceptional circumstance that the sprint qualifying session does not take place at a 
Competition, and with acceptance of the Stewards that the session cannot take place, the grid 
for the sprint will be defined based upon the Drivers’ Championship classification. In such 
circumstance, the procedure defined in Article 42.3 shall be applied using the Drivers’"
54," 
 
Championship classification of each driver instead of their sprint qualifying session classification, 
all drivers shall be considered to be classified. 
If neither of the methods of forming the grid for the sprint session described above can be 
applied, the formation of the grid for the sprint session shall be at the sole discretion of the 
Stewards. 
42.3 
Starting from a nominally empty grid, drivers will be allocated their grid positions in the following 
sequence of steps: 
a) 
Classified drivers who have received 15 or less cumulative grid penalties will be allocated 
a temporary grid position equal to their qualifying session or sprint qualifying session 
classification plus the sum of their grid penalties. If two or more drivers share a temporary 
grid position, their relative order will be determined in accordance with their qualifying 
session or sprint qualifying session classification, with the slowest driver keeping their 
allocated temporary grid position, and the other drivers getting temporary grid positions 
immediately ahead of them. 
b) 
Following the allocation of temporary grid positions to penalised drivers in accordance 
with (a), unpenalised classified drivers will be allocated any unoccupied grid position, in 
the sequence of their qualifying session or sprint qualifying session classification. 
c) 
Following the allocation of grid positions to unpenalised classified drivers, penalised 
drivers with a temporary grid position, as defined in (a), will be moved up to fill any 
unoccupied grid position.  
d) 
Classified drivers who have accrued more than 15 cumulative grid position penalties will 
start behind any other classified driver. Their relative position will be determined in 
accordance with their qualifying session or sprint qualifying session classification. 
e) 
Unclassified drivers who have been permitted to participate by the Stewards will be 
allocated grid positions behind all the classified drivers. Their relative positions will be 
determined in accordance with Article 39.4 (b). 
42.4 
The provisional starting grid will be published no less than two (2) hours before the scheduled 
start of the formation lap for the sprint session or the race. Any Competitor whose car(s) is (are) 
unable to start for any reason whatsoever (or who has good reason to believe that their car(s) 
will not be ready to start) must inform the stewards accordingly at the earliest opportunity and, 
in any event, no later than one and a quarter (1¼) hours before the scheduled start of the 
formation lap of the sprint session or the race. 
a) 
If one or more cars are withdrawn the grid will be closed-up accordingly. 
b) 
The final starting grid will be published one (1) hour before the scheduled start of the 
formation lap for the sprint session or the race. 
c) 
The Grid position of any car(s) withdrawn or unable to start after the time referred to by 
42.4 b) will remain vacant. 
42.5 
The grid will be in a staggered 1 x 1 formation and the rows on the grid will be separated by 16 
metres.

SPRINT SESSION STARTING PROCEDURE 
43.1 
The sprint session start procedure detailed below will only be used at those Competitions where 
a sprint session is scheduled."
55," 
 
43.2 
30 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the pit exit will be opened and all 
cars, including any that are required to start the sprint session from the pit lane, will be 
permitted to leave the pit lane to cover one (1) reconnaissance lap. 
 
At the end of this lap all cars starting the sprint session from the grid should stop on the grid in 
starting order with their engines stopped and all cars required to start the sprint session from 
the pit lane must enter the pit lane. 
 
All drivers going to the pit exit at this time must do so at a constant speed and with constant 
throttle. This applies over the whole of the pit lane. 
 
Any car which does not complete a reconnaissance lap and reach the grid under its own power 
will not be permitted to start the sprint session from the grid. 
43.3 
27 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap, a warning signal will be given 
indicating that the end of the pit lane will be closed in two minutes. 
 
25 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the pit exit will be closed and a 
second warning signal will be given.  
Any car which is still in the pit lane can start from the end of the pit lane provided it got there 
under its own power. If more than one car is affected, they must line up in the order established 
under Article 42.3 in which they qualified. However, any car reaching the end of the pit lane 
after the five (5) minute signal must start behind any car already at the pit exit. 
43.4 
The approach of the start will be announced by signals shown ten (10) minutes, five (5) minutes, 
three (3) minutes, one (1) minute and fifteen (15) seconds before the start of the formation lap, 
each of which will be accompanied by an audible warning. 
 
When the ten (10) minute signal is shown, everybody except drivers, officials and team technical 
staff must leave the grid. 
43.5 
When the five (5) minute signal is shown all cars on the grid and any cars in the pit lane fast lane 
must: 
a) 
have their wheels fitted; and 
b) 
tyre blankets on the wheels fitted must be disconnected from any power supply at this 
time and must not be reconnected during the start procedure, unless the delayed start or 
aborted start signal is subsequently shown; and 
c) 
team personnel and equipment trolleys must commence leaving the grid. 
 
A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have 
all its wheels fully fitted at the five (5) minute signal. 
After this signal wheels may only be removed in the pit lane inner lane.  
43.6 
When the three (3) minute signal is shown, no more than sixteen (16) team personnel for each 
Competitor are permitted on the grid. 
43.7 
When the one (1) minute signal is shown, engines should be started and all team personnel must 
leave the grid, and the pit lane fast lane if working in accordance with Article 34.9, by the time 
the fifteen (15) second signal is given taking all equipment with them. 
a) 
If any team personnel are touching a car or team equipment is connected to a car on the 
grid after the fifteen (15) second signal has been shown, the driver of the car concerned 
must start the sprint session from the pit lane as specified in Article 43.3. A penalty in 
accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to start the sprint 
session from the pit lane."
56," 
 
If any team personnel are touching a car or team equipment is connected to a car that is 
in the pit lane fast lane after the fifteen (15) second signal has been shown a penalty in 
accordance with Article 54.3 c will be imposed on that driver. 
b) 
If any driver needs assistance after the fifteen (15) second signal he must raise his arm 
and, when the remainder of the cars able to do so have left the grid, marshals will be 
instructed to push the car into the pit lane inner lane. 
 
In either of the above cases, marshals with yellow flags will stand beside any car (or cars) 
concerned to warn drivers behind. 
43.8 
When the green lights on the start gantry are illuminated, all cars on the grid able to do so should 
begin the formation lap with the pole position driver leading. When leaving the grid all drivers 
must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position. 
Once all cars on track have passed the end of the pit lane on the formation lap, the pit exit will 
be opened and all cars starting from the pit lane able to do so must leave the pit lane and join 
the formation lap. When such cars are permitted to leave the pit lane they must do so in the 
order that was established under Article 43.3 unless another car is unduly delayed. Once all such 
cars have left the pit lane the pit exit will be closed. All such cars must enter the pit lane at the 
end of the formation lap. 
43.9 
During the formation lap practice starts are forbidden and the formation must be kept as tight 
as possible. 
43.10 Overtaking during the formation lap is only permitted if a car is delayed and cars behind cannot 
avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. In this case, drivers may only

43.12 When the cars required to start from the pit lane return to the pit lane at the end of the 
formation lap or laps, they must proceed to pit exit at a constant speed and with constant 
throttle and stop in a line in the fast lane in the order in which they arrive, keeping their engines 
running. Once all cars on track have passed the end of the pit lane for the first time after the 
start, the pit exit will be opened and all cars starting from the pit lane may then join the sprint 
session. 
43.13 If a car is immobilised on the starting grid at any time after the formation lap has commenced

RACE STARTING PROCEDURE 
44.1 
Forty (40) minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the pit exit will be opened 
and all cars, including any that are required to start the race from the pit lane, will be permitted 
to leave the pit lane to cover a reconnaissance lap. Should any driver wish to cover more than 
one reconnaissance lap, this must be done by driving down the pit entry road and pit lane at 
greatly reduced speed between each of the laps. If a driver stops in his pit between 
reconnaissance laps the car may only re-join the track by being driven from the driver’s garage 
and not from his pit stop position. 
 
At the end of these laps all cars starting the race from the grid should stop on the grid in starting 
order with their engines stopped and all cars required to start the race from the pit lane must 
enter the pit lane. 
 
All drivers going to the pit exit at this time must do so at a constant speed and with constant 
throttle. This applies over the whole of the pit lane whether a driver is going to the pit exit from 
his garage or travelling through the pit lane between reconnaissance laps. 
 
Any car which does not complete a reconnaissance lap and reach the grid under its own power 
will not be permitted to start the race from the grid. 
44.2 
Thirty-two (32) minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap, a warning signal will be 
given indicating that the end of the pit lane will be closed in two minutes. 
 
Thirty (30) minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the pit exit will be closed and 
a second warning signal will be given.  
 
Any car which is still in the pit lane can start from the end of the pit lane provided it got there 
under its own power. If more than one car is affected, they must line up in the order established 
under Article 42.3 in which they qualified. However, any car reaching the end of the pit lane 
after the five (5) minute signal must start behind any car already at the pit exit. 
44.3 
The approach of the start will be announced by signals shown ten (10) minutes, five (5) minutes, 
three (3) minutes, one (1) minute and fifteen (15) seconds before the start of the formation lap, 
each of which will be accompanied by an audible warning. 
 
When the ten (10) minute signal is shown, everybody except drivers, officials and team technical 
staff must leave the grid. 
44.4 
When the five (5) minute signal is shown all cars on the grid and any cars in the pit lane fast lane 
must:"
58," 
 
a) 
have their wheels fitted; and 
b) 
tyre blankets on the wheels fitted must be disconnected from any power supply at this 
time and must not be reconnected during the start procedure, unless the delayed start or 
aborted start signal is subsequently shown; and 
c) 
team personnel and equipment trolleys must commence leaving the grid. 
 
A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have 
all its wheels fully fitted at the five (5) minute signal. 
After this signal wheels may only be removed in the pit lane inner lane.  
44.5 
When the three (3) minute signal is shown, no more than sixteen (16) team personnel for each 
Competitor are permitted on the grid. 
44.6 
When the one (1) minute signal is shown, engines should be started and all team personnel must 
leave the grid, and the pit lane fast lane if working in accordance with Article 34.9, by the time 
the fifteen (15) second signal is given taking all equipment with them. 
a)  
If any team personnel are touching a car or team equipment is connected to a car on the 
grid after the fifteen (15) second signal has been shown the driver of the car concerned 
must start the race from the pit lane as specified in Article 44.2. A penalty in accordance 
with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to start the race from the pit 
lane. 
If any team personnel are touching a car or team equipment is connected to a car that is 
in the pit lane fast lane after the fifteen (15) second signal has been shown a penalty in 
accordance with Article 54.3c will be imposed on that driver. 
b) 
If any driver needs assistance after the fifteen (15) second signal he must raise his arm 
and, when the remainder of the cars able to do so have left the grid, marshals will be 
instructed to push the car into the pit lane inner lane. 
 
In either of the above cases, marshals with yellow flags will stand beside any car (or cars) 
concerned to warn drivers behind. 
44.7 
When the green lights on the start gantry are illuminated, all cars on the grid able to do so should 
begin the formation lap with the pole position driver leading. When leaving the grid all drivers

Once all cars on track have passed the end of the pit lane for the formation lap, the pit exit will 
be opened and all cars starting from the pit lane able to do so must leave the pit lane and join 
the formation lap. When such cars are permitted to leave the pit lane they must do so in the 
order that was established under Article 44.2 unless another car is unduly delayed. Once all such 
cars have left the pit lane the pit exit will be closed. All such cars must enter the pit lane at the 
end of the formation lap. 
44.8 
During the formation lap practice starts are forbidden and the formation must be kept as tight 
as possible. 
44.9 
Overtaking during the formation lap is only permitted if a car is delayed and cars behind cannot 
avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. In this case, drivers may only 
overtake to re-establish the original starting order. Any driver delayed in this way, and who is 
unable to re-establish the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line, must 
enter the pit lane and start from the end of the pit lane as specified in Article 44.11. 
 
A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the 
pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety 
car line."

44.10 When the cars starting from the grid return to the grid at the end of the formation lap or laps, 
they must stop within their respective starting grid positions, keeping their engines running. 
a) 
There will be a standing start, the signal being given by means of lights activated by the 
permanent starter. 
b) 
Once all the cars have come to a halt the five (5) second light will appear followed by the 
four, three, two and one second lights. At any time after the one-second light appears, 
the race will be started by extinguishing all red lights. 
44.11 When the cars required to start from the pit lane return to the pit lane at the end of the 
formation lap or laps, they must proceed to pit exit at a constant speed and with constant 
throttle and stop in a line in the fast lane in the order in which they arrive, keeping their engines 
running. Once all cars on track have passed the end of the pit lane for the first time after the 
start, the pit exit will be opened and all cars starting from the pit lane may then join the race. 
44.12 If a car is immobilised on the starting grid at any time after the formation lap has commenced 
and prior to the race start: 
a)  
The driver must immediately raise their hands above their head to signal they have a 
problem; 
b) 
The marshals alongside the grid, responsible for that row, must immediately wave a 
yellow flag and/or activate the yellow grid light panel to signal that a car is immobilised 
on the grid;  
c)  
When the Race Director deems it is safe to do so, it shall be the duty of the marshals to 
push any immobilised car into the pit lane inner lane by the fastest route. Any driver being 
pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car; and 
d) 
Once the car is in the pit lane inner lane team personnel may attempt to start it, if 
successful the driver may enter the fast lane once the pit exit is opened in accordance 
with Article 44.11 and re-join the race. The driver and mechanics must follow the 
instructions of the marshals at all times during such a procedure. 
44.13 Unless specifically authorised by the Safety Delegate, during the start of a race the pit wall must 
be kept free of all persons with the exception of the team personnel permitted under Article 
26.12, officials and fire marshals. 
 
45) 
EXTRA FORMATION LAP 
45.1 
If at any time after the formation lap has commenced and prior to the start of the sprint session

accordance with Article 43.13 or 44.12, once the car is in the pit lane team personnel may 
attempt to rectify the problem and, if successful, the car may then start from the end of the pit 
lane. Should there be more than one car involved their starting order will be determined by the 
order in which they reached the end of the pit lane. 
45.3 
If another problem arises which does not necessitate the start to be aborted (see Article 47), the 
Race Director may decide another extra formation lap is required, in such case drivers must carry 
out another extra formation lap as described in Article 45.1.

Competitor concerned and will inform all Competitors using the official messaging 
system. 
 
b) 
With the exception of Articles 54.3a) and 54.3b) above, from the time the Competitor 
concerned is notified of the stewards’ decision using the official messaging system the 
relevant driver may cross the Line on the track no more than twice before entering the 
pit lane and, in the case of a penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d), proceeding to his 
pit stop position where he shall remain for the period of the time penalty. 
 
 
However, unless the driver was already in the pit entry road for the purpose of serving his 
penalty, he may not carry out the penalty if the VSC procedure is in use or after the safety 
car has been deployed. The number of times the driver crosses the Line behind the safety 
car or during the VSC procedure will be added to the maximum number of times he may 
cross the Line on the track. 
 
c) 
Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a penalty in accordance 
with Articles 54.3a) or 54.3b) above, it may not be worked on until the car has been 
stationary for the duration of the penalty.  In this context, touching the car or driver by 
hand or tools or equipment will all constitute working. 
 
d) 
Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a time penalty in accordance 
with Article 54.3d) above it may not be worked on. However, if the engine stops any work 
necessary to re-start it may be carried out after the time penalty period has elapsed. If 
the Competitor is unable to start the engine the car may then only be worked on in the 
driver’s garage. 
 
e) 
Any breach or failure to comply with Articles 54.4b), 54.4c) or 54.4d) may result in a 
further penalty, such penalty will supersede and replace the penalty which was subject to 
the breach or failure to comply. 
 
 55) SAFETY CAR 
55.1 
The FIA safety car will be driven by an FIA appointed safety car driver and will carry an FIA safety 
car observer capable of recognising all the competing cars who is in permanent radio contact 
with race control. 
55.2 
Prior to the pit lane opening for a reconnaissance lap, the safety car will leave the pit lane and 
take up position at the front of the grid and remain there until the five (5) minute signal is given. 
At this point (except under Article 49) it will cover a lap of the track and take up position. 
55.3 
The safety car may be brought into operation to neutralise a sprint session or a race upon the 
order of the clerk of the course. It will be used only if Competitors or officials are in immediate 
physical danger on or near the track but the circumstances are not such as to necessitate 
suspending the sprint session or the race. 
55.4 
When the order is given to deploy the safety car the message “SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED” will be 
sent to all Competitors via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “SC” and 
all marshal’s posts will display waved yellow flags and “SC” boards for the duration of the 
intervention. 
55.5 
No car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed 
potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person at any time whilst the safety car is 
deployed. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry road, 
or the pit lane."
66," 
 
55.6 
The safety car will join the track with its orange lights illuminated and will do so regardless of 
where the leader is. 
55.7 
All competing cars must reduce speed and form up in line behind the safety car no more than 
ten car lengths apart. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from the time at 
which all Competitors have been sent the “SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED” message using the official 
messaging system until the time that each car crosses the first safety car line for the second 
time, drivers must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each 
marshalling sector and at both the first and second safety car lines (a marshalling sector is 
defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels). 
 
The stewards may impose either of the penalties under Article 54.3a), 54.3b), 54.3c) or 54.3d) 
on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum time as required by the above. 
55.8 
With the exception of the cases listed under a) to h) below, no driver may overtake another car 
on the track, including the safety car, until he passes the Line (see Article 5.3) for the first time 
after the safety car has returned to the pits. 
The exceptions are: 
 
a) 
If a driver is signalled to do so from the safety car, by use of the green light on the safety 
car. 
 
b) 
Under Articles 49.5, 55.14, 58.7, and 58.11. 
 
c) 
When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track, including 
the safety car, after he has reached the first safety car line. 
 
d) 
When leaving the pits a driver may overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on the track 
before he reaches the second safety car line. 
 
e) 
When the safety car is returning to the pits it may be overtaken by cars on the track once 
it has reached the first safety car line. 
 
f) 
Subject to the provisions of Article 55.11, whilst in the pit entry road, pit lane or pit exit 
road a driver may overtake another car which is also in one of these three areas. 
 
g) 
Any car stopping in its designated garage area whilst the safety car is using the pit lane 
(see Article 55.11 below) may be overtaken. 
 
h) 
If any car slows with an obvious problem. 
55.9 
When ordered to do so by the clerk of the course the green light on observer in the safety car 
will use be illuminated a green light to signal to any cars between it and the leader that they are 
required to should pass. Once all such cars have passed the safety car the green light on the 
safety car will be extinguished to signal that overtaking is no longer permitted, with the 
exception of the cases listed in Article 55.8.  
These cars will continue at reduced speed and without overtaking until they reach the line of 
cars behind the safety car. 
55.10 Except under Article 55.14 below, the safety car shall be used at least until the leader is behind 
it and all remaining cars are lined up behind him. 
 
Once behind the safety car, the leader must keep within ten (10) car lengths of it (except under 
Article 55.14 below). 
55.11 Under certain circumstances the clerk of the course may ask the cars and the safety car to use 
the pit lane. In these cases, a signal to use the pit lane will be displayed before the start of the 
pit entry road and all Competitors will be informed using the official messaging system, all cars 
must then enter the pit lane, drive through it and re-join the track. In these circumstances, whilst"
67," 
 
in the pit entry road or pit exit road a driver may not overtake another car which is also in one 
of these areas, unless any car slows with an obvious problem. Any car entering the pit lane under 
these circumstances may stop at its designated garage area. A penalty in accordance with Article 
54.3c) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane when required to do so. 
55.12  Other than when the cars and the safety car are required to use the pit lane, no car may enter 
the pits whilst the safety car is deployed unless it is for the purpose of changing tyres. 
55.13 If the clerk of the course considers track conditions are unsuitable for overtaking the message 
“OVERTAKING WILL NOT BE PERMITTED” will be sent to all Competitors using the official 
messaging system. 
55.14 If the clerk of the course considers it safe to do so, and the message “LAPPED CARS MAY NOW 
OVERTAKE” will be has been sent to all Competitors using the official messaging system, and the 
green light on the safety car will be illuminated to signal to all cars that have been lapped by the 
leader that they are will be required to pass the cars on the lead lap and the safety car.  
 
This will only apply to cars that were lapped at the time they crossed the Line at the end of the 
lap during which they crossed the first Safety Car line for the second time after the safety car 
was deployed. 
Whilst they are overtaking the cars on the lead lap and the safety car, and in order to ensure 
this may be carried out safely, the cars on the lead lap must always stay on the racing line unless 
deviating from it is unavoidable.  
Once all such cars have passed the safety car, the green light on the safety car will be 
extinguished to signal that overtaking is no longer permitted, with the exception of the cases 
listed in Article 55.8. 
Having overtaken the cars on the lead lap and the safety car these cars should then proceed 
around the track at an appropriate speed, without overtaking and they must make every effort 
to take up position at the back of the line of cars behind the safety car. Whilst such cars are 
proceeding around the track to rejoin the line of cars behind the safety car, and at the sole 
discretion of the race director, the pit lane exit may be closed when the safety car and line of 
cars behind it are approaching and passing the pit lane exit. 
Whilst they are overtaking, and in order to ensure this may be carried out safely, the cars on the 
lead lap must always stay on the racing line unless deviating from it is unavoidable.  
Unless the clerk of the course considers the presence of the safety car is still necessary, once 
the message “LAPPED CARS MAY NOW OVERTAKE” has been sent to all Competitors using the 
official messaging system, the safety car will return to the pits at the end of the following lap. 
55.15 When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car the message “SAFETY CAR 
IN THIS LAP” will be sent to all Competitors using the official messaging system and the car’s 
orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the Competitors and drivers that it 
will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap. 
 
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall 
more than ten (10) car lengths behind it. 
 
In order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the 
point at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves 
no erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other 
drivers or impede the restart."
68," 
 
 
As the safety car is approaching the pit entry road the SC boards will be withdrawn and, other 
than on the last lap of the sprint session or the race, as the leader approaches the Line the yellow 
flags will be withdrawn and a green flag and/or green light panel will be displayed at the Line. 
55.16 Each lap completed while the safety car is deployed will be counted as a sprint session lap or 
race lap. However, if the procedure set out in Article 49 is followed, Article 5.3a)ii) or Article 
5.4c) as appropriate will apply. 
55.17 If the safety car is still deployed at the beginning of the last lap, or is deployed during the last 
lap, it will enter the pit lane at the end of the lap and the cars will take the end-of-session signal 
as normal without overtaking. 
 
56) 
VIRTUAL SAFETY CAR (VSC) 
56.1 
The VSC procedure may be initiated to neutralise a practice session, sprint session or a race upon 
the order of the clerk of the course. 
a) 
It will normally be used when double waved yellow flags are needed on any section of 
track and Competitors or officials may be in danger, but the circumstances are not such 
as to warrant use of the safety car itself. 
56.2 
When the order is given to initiate the VSC procedure a message “VSC DEPLOYED” will be sent 
to all Competitors using the official messaging system and all FIA light panels will display “VSC”. 
56.3 
No car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed 
potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person at any time whilst the VSC procedure 
is in use. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry road, or 
the pit lane. 
56.4 
When initiated during a sprint session or a race, no car may enter the pits whilst the VSC 
procedure is in use unless it is for the purpose of changing tyres. 
56.5 
All competing cars must reduce speed and stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at 
least once in each marshalling sector and at both the first and second safety car lines (a 
marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels). All 
cars must also be above this minimum time when the FIA light panels change to green (see 
Article 56.7 below). 
 
When initiated during the sprint session or a race, the stewards may impose any of the penalties 
under Article 54.3a), 54.3b), 54.3c) or 54.3d) on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum 
time as required by the above. 
56.6 
With the exception of the cases listed under a) to d) below, no driver may overtake another car 
on the track whilst the VSC procedure is in use. 
 
The exceptions are: 
 
a) 
When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track after he has 
reached the first safety car line. 
 
b) 
When leaving the pits a driver may overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on the track 
before he reaches the second safety car line. 
 
c) 
Whilst in the pit entry road, pit lane or pit exit road a driver may overtake another car 
which is also in one of these three areas. 
 
d) 
If any car slows with an obvious problem."
69," 
 
56.7 
When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to end the VSC procedure the message “VSC 
ENDING” will be sent to all Competitors via the official messaging system and, at any time 
between 10 and 15 seconds later, “VSC” on the FIA light panels will change to green and drivers 
may continue the session or continue racing immediately. After 30 seconds the green lights will 
be extinguished. 
56.8 
Each lap completed whist the VSC procedure is in use during a sprint session or the race will be 
counted as a lap. 
 
57) 
SUSPENDING A SPRINT SESSION OR A RACE 
57.1 
If Competitors or officials are placed in immediate physical danger by cars running on the track, 
and the clerk of the course deems circumstances are such that the track cannot be negotiated 
safely, even behind the safety car, the sprint session or the race will be suspended. 
 
Should it become necessary to suspend the sprint session or the race, the clerk of the course 
will order red flags to be shown at all marshal posts and the abort orange lights on the start 
gantry to be illuminated shown at the Line. 
57.2 
When the signal is given overtaking is forbidden, the pit exit will be closed and all cars must 
proceed slowly into the pit lane. The first car to arrive in the pit lane should proceed directly to 
the pit exit staying in the fast lane, all the other cars should form up in a line behind the first car. 
In exceptional circumstances, for reasons of safety the pit entry may be closed before cars have 
returned to the pit lane. In such circumstances all cars must proceed slowly to the starting grid, 
the first car to arrive on the grid should occupy pole position and others should fill the remaining 
grid positions in the order they arrive. The remainder of the procedures detailed in Articles 57.3, 
57.4, 57.5 and 58 shall remain unchanged, but will be conducted on the grid instead of in the 
fast lane. 
57.3 
Any cars unable to return to the pit lane as a result of the track being blocked will be brought 
back when the track is cleared and will be arranged in the order they occupied before the sprint 
session or the race was suspended. 
 
Any cars in the pit lane or pit entry road at the time the sprint session or the race was suspended 
will be arranged in the order they occupied before the sprint session or the race was suspended. 
Any cars in their garage at the time the sprint session or the race was suspended will be arranged 
at the back of the line of cars in the fast lane in the order they got there.  
 
In all cases the order will be taken at the last point at which it was possible to determine the 
position of all cars. All such cars will then be permitted to resume the sprint session or the race. 
 
The Safety Car will then be driven to the front of the line of cars in the fast lane. 
57.4 
Whilst the sprint session or the race is suspended: 
 
a) 
The sprint session, the race nor the timekeeping system will stop, however, in accordance 
with Article 5.3a)iii) the length of the sprint session suspension or in accordance with 
Article 5.4d) the length of the race suspension will be added to the maximum time period. 
 
b) 
Cars may be worked on once they have stopped in the fast lane but any such work is 
restricted to that listed in Articles 57.4b)i) to x) and must not impede the resumption of 
the sprint session or the race. 
i) 
Starting the engine and any directly associated preparation. 
ii)  
The addition of compressed gases (see Article 4.5 of the Technical Regulations). 
iii) 
The fitting or removal of permitted cooling and heating devices. 
iv) 
Changes to the air ducts around the front and rear brakes."
70," 
 
v) 
Changes to the radiator ducts. 
vi) 
Changes made for driver comfort. 
vii) 
Changing wheels and tyres. 
viii) 
Repair of genuine accident damage, as specified in Article 40.2 g), including the 
replacement of assemblies containing such damaged parts. 
ix) 
The aerodynamic set up of the front wing may be adjusted using the existing parts. 
No parts may be added, removed or replaced. 
x) 
If a Heat Hazard has been declared in accordance with Article 26.19, the cooling 
medium used in the Driver Cooling System, as defined in Article 14.6 of the 
Technical Regulations,  may be replenished or replaced. 
 
c) 
Only team members, officials and duly accredited television cameramen will be permitted 
in the pit lane. 
57.5 
Unless asked to do so by the FIA, cars may not be moved from the fast lane whilst the sprint 
session or the race is suspended. Any driver whose car is moved from the fast lane to any other 
part of the pit lane will be arranged at the back of the line of cars in the fast lane in the order 
they got there. At all times drivers must follow the directions of the marshals. 
 
58) 
RESUMING A SPRINT SESSION OR A RACE 
58.1 
The delay will be kept as short as possible and as soon as a resumption time is known all 
Competitors will be informed via the official messaging system, in all cases at least ten (10) 
minutes warning will be given. 
If the sprint session or the race is being resumed in wet conditions and the Race Director deems 
it necessary, the use of wet-weather tyres as specified under Article 30.5n is compulsory. If this 
is the case, at the ten (10) minute signal the orange lights on of the safety car will be illuminated. 
At the same time this will be confirmed to all Competitors using the official messaging system. 
58.2 
Signals will be shown ten minutes, five minutes, three minutes, one minute and fifteen seconds 
before the resumption and each of these will be accompanied by an audible warning. 
58.3 
When the five (5) minute signal is shown, if not already illuminated in accordance with Article 
58.1, the orange lights of the safety car will be illuminated. All cars must have their wheels fitted. 
Tyre blankets must also be disconnected from any power supply at this time and must not be 
reconnected during the start procedure, unless the delayed start signal is shown. After this signal 
wheels may only be removed if the car has been moved out of the fast lane or during a further 
suspension. 
 
A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have 
all its wheels fully fitted at the five (5) minute signal or has any of its wheels changed before it 
leaves the pit lane after the sprint session or the race has been resumed. 
58.4 
At the Two (2) minutes point prior to the resumption any cars between the safety car and the 
leader, in addition to any cars that had been lapped by the leader at the time the sprint session 
or the race was suspended, will be allowed to leave the pit lane and complete a further lap, 
without overtaking, enter the pit lane and then re-join the line of cars behind the safety car. 
If track conditions are considered suitable to resume the sprint session or the race from a 
standing start, the message “STANDING START PROCEDURE” will be sent to all Competitors. If 
track conditions are considered unsuitable to resume the sprint session or the race from a 
standing start, the message “ROLLING START PROCEDURE” will be sent to all Competitors. In"
71," 
 
both cases such messages will be sent using the official messaging system at a time no later than 
one (1) minute signal detailed in Article 58.5.  
58.5 
When the one (1) minute signal is shown, engines should be started and all team personnel must 
leave the fast lane by the time the fifteen (15) second signal is given taking all equipment with 
them. If any team personnel are touching a car or team equipment is connected to a car in the 
fast lane after the fifteen (15) second signal has been shown the driver of the car concerned 
must enter the pit lane following the reconnaissance laps behind the Safety Car described in 
Article 58.10, or the formation lap described in Article 58.11,  and resume the race from the pit 
lane as specified in Article 44.2. A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on 
any driver who fails to start the race from the pit lane. 
If any driver needs assistance after the fifteen (15) second signal, he must raise his arm and, 
when the remainder of the cars able to do so have left the pit lane, marshals will be instructed 
to push the car into the inner lane. In this case, marshals with yellow flags will stand beside any 
car concerned to warn drivers behind. Drivers may leave the fast lane in order to pass any car 
unable to leave the pit lane. 
58.6 
The sprint session or the race will be resumed when the pit exit is opened. Subject to the 
provisions of a), at this point the safety car will leave the pit lane and all drivers must follow the 
safety car no more than ten car lengths apart.  
a) 
In the case of a standing start procedure, see Article 58.11, at the sole discretion of the 
Race Director the safety car may remain in the pit lane. In such case the message “SAFETY 
CAR WILL REMAIN IN THE PIT LANE” will be sent to all Competitors using the official 
messaging system, and the orange lights on the safety car will be extinguished, at a time 
after the one (1) minute signal detailed in Article 58.5 and prior to the pit lane opening to 
resume the sprint session or race. When the pit exit is opened to resume the sprint session 
or race, all cars should leave the pit lane and proceed directly to the grid. The first car in 
line may dictate the pace. 
58.7 
Overtaking behind the safety car, or during the lap to grid described in Article 58.6a), is only 
permitted in the following cases: 
 
a) 
Drivers may leave the fast lane in order to overtake any car delayed with an obvious 
problem when leaving its position in the fast lane, or  
 
b) 
Whilst in the pit entry road, pit lane or pit exit road a driver may overtake another car 
which is also in this one of these three areas, or 
 
c) 
If any car slows with an obvious problem, or 
 
d) 
If a car is delayed during the lap(s) behind the safety car, or during the lap to grid described 
in Article 58.6a). 
58.8 
In any of the cases detailed in Article 58.7, drivers may only overtake to re-establish the original 
starting order or the order the cars were in at the pit exit when the sprint session or race was 
resumed: 
a)   
Under a “STANDING START PROCEDURE” as detailed in Article 58.11, the driver of any car 
that is delayed in any of the cases detailed in Article 58.7 may overtake to re-establish the 
original starting position provided they do so before they cross the first safety car line on 
either the lap the safety car returns to the pits, or the lap to grid described in Article 58.6a) 
as applicable. Should they fail to do so they must re-enter the pit lane and may only re-
join the race once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane after the sprint session 
or the race has been resumed."
72," 
 
 
 
A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to re-
enter the pit lane if they have not re-established the original starting order before they 
reach the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits. 
 
b) 
Under a “ROLLING START PROCEDURE” as detailed in Article 58.12, the driver of any car 
that is delayed in any of the cases detailed in Article 58.7 may overtake to re-establish the 
original starting order provided they do so before the message “ROLLING START” is sent 
to all competitors using the official messaging system. Should they fail to do so, they must 
resume the sprint session or race from where they are. 
58.8 
The sprint session or the race will be resumed behind the safety car when the pit exit is opened, 
and the safety car leaves the pit lane. Drivers must follow the safety car no more than ten car 
lengths apart.  
58.9 
Either of the penalties prescribed in Article 54.3c) or 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who, 
in the opinion of the stewards, unnecessarily overtook another car during the lap (or laps). 
58.10 Unless it remained in the pit lane in accordance with Article 58.6a, the safety car will enter the 
pits lane after one (1) lap unless: 
 
a) 
The sprint session or the race is being resumed in wet conditions and The Race Director 
deems more than one lap is necessary. 
 
b) 
All cars are not yet in a line behind the safety car. 
 
c)  
A further incident occurs necessitating another intervention. 
58.11   If track conditions are considered suitable to resume the sprint session or the race from a 
standing start, the message “STANDING START PROCEDURE” will be sent to all Competitors using 
the official messaging system at a time no later than one (1) minute signal detailed in Article 
58.5.   
All FIA light panels will display “SS” and the safety car’s orange lights will be extinguished. 
At the discretion of the Race Director, the safety car may (a) stay in the pit lane, or (b) extinguish 
its orange lights and pull to the side of the track, letting all cars that are eligible to take the 
standing start overtake it. In such case(s), the signal “ALL CARS MAY OVERTAKE THE SAFETY CAR” 
will be sent to all Competitors using the official messaging system. 
 
In the case of a standing start procedure, when the clerk of the course decides it is safe to do so, 
the message “STANDING START” will be sent to all Competitors using the official messaging 
system, all FIA light panels will display “SS”, the pit lane exit will be closed, and, if deployed, the 
orange lights on the safety car will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the Competitors 
and drivers that, if applicable, the safety car will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap, 
and that from this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace, if 
necessary falling more than ten (10) car lengths behind the safety car. 
With the exception of those that were in their garage at the time the sprint session or the race 
was suspended (see Article 57.3), or those who have been moved from the fast lane (see Article 
57.5), can return to the grid, take up their grid positions and follow the procedures set out in 
Articles 43.11, 43.13 and 43.14 or Articles 44.10, 44.12 and 44.13 as relevant.  
Cars that were in their garage at the time the sprint session or the race was suspended (see 
Article 57.3), or those who have been moved from the fast lane (see Article 57.5) will be 
permitted to leave the pit lane when the sprint session or the race is resumed, but must re-enter 
the pit lane and may join the sprint session or the race once the last car has passed the pit exit 
after the re-start. A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver who 
fails to resume the sprint session or race from the pit lane."
73," 
 
Each lap completed using the procedures set out above will be counted as a sprint session lap 
or a race lap as appropriate. 
58.12 If track conditions are considered unsuitable to resume the sprint session or the race from a 
standing start, the message “ROLLING START PROCEDURE” will be sent to all Competitors using 
the official messaging system, at a time no later than one (1) minute signal detailed in Article 
58.5. 
 
In the case of a rolling start procedure,  when the clerk of the course decides it is safe to do so, 
call in the safety car the message “ROLLING START” will be sent to all Competitors using the 
official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “RS”, the pit lane exit will be closed, 
and the safety car’s orange lights on the safety car will be extinguished. This will be the signal to 
the Competitors and drivers that the safety car will be entering the pit lane at the end of that 
lap, and that from At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace 
and, if necessary, falling more than ten (10) car lengths behind the safety car it. 
 
As the safety car is approaching the pit entry road the FIA light panels will be extinguished and 
a green flag and/or green light panel will be displayed at the Line. 
Cars that were in their garage at the time the sprint session or the race was suspended (see 
Article 57.3), or those who have been moved from the fast lane (see Article 57.5) will be

We collect much of this information from you directly, such as through our various registration, entry 
and licence forms and portals. We also collect some of this information from other motorsport 
participants with whom you interact, such as your employer, officials, your previous employers, other 
Drivers and Competitors and from broadcasters and the media. This is especially true where we carry 
out our integrity and disciplinary role. 
As part of our integrity activities, we also actively gather intelligence from relevant sources, including 
members of the public and publicly available sources. We also collect data from anti-doping 
organisations (such as the World Anti-Doping Agency and National Anti-Doping Organisations) and our 
appointed anti-doping service provider. 
Where you choose to involve a third party, for example, your employer, a representative, lawyer or 
relative, we will receive and share data with this person or organisation. 
Why we collect, use and store this personal data 
We are usually required to have a lawful basis to process your data. We explain each of these legal 
bases below. We also set out the purposes for which we process your data. For each purpose, we 
explain the lawful basis for that processing, the processing operations that we carry out and the 
categories of data that we process.  
Legal bases relied on by the FIA for motorsport related processing 
Consent – sometimes we ask for your consent to use your data.  
Contract – if we have an agreement in place with you, we may process your data where it is necessary 
for us to meet our obligations or enforce our rights under the contract. 
Legitimate interest – we can process your data when this is necessary for us to achieve a legitimate 
business purpose, or where this is necessary for someone else to achieve their legitimate purpose. We 
explain below what interests we, or others, are trying to achieve when we process your data. Where 
we process personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest, we consider what the impact of the 
processing will be on affected individuals and determine whether those individuals’ interests outweigh 
our interests in the processing taking place.  
Legal obligation – we have obligations to comply with legal and regulatory requirements under various 
applicable laws. In certain cases, we have to use your data to meet these obligations.  
Vital interests – in exceptional circumstances, we may rely on the need to protect your vital interests 
to process certain data, particularly sharing information as needed with medical professionals for 
safety purposes. 
Where we process your special category data – such as information relating to your health, biometric 
data that might identify you, your ethnicity, your religion, your sex life or sexual orientation, your trade 
union membership or your political opinions – we usually require a further lawful basis. These are as 
follows: 
Explicit consent – we may ask you to consent to use this data;"
83,"union membership or your political opinions – we usually require a further lawful basis. These are as 
follows: 
Explicit consent – we may ask you to consent to use this data; 
Medical diagnosis/preventative and occupation medicine – we will only process data for medical 
purposes where required by law, or under the supervision of a health professional who is subject to 
an obligation of professional secrecy;"
84," 
 
Substantial public interest, as set out in law – the law may make special provision for our processing, 
for example in relation to health and safety requirements; 
Establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims – we are entitled to process special category data 
where this is necessary to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; 
Scientific research, as permitted by law – we will use your special category data for research where 
we can demonstrate that we meet legal requirements and have applied appropriate safeguards; 
Vital interest – again, in exceptional circumstances, we rely on the need to protect your vital interests 
to process your special category data. 
For certain types of processing, the FIA may be exempt from the requirement to have a lawful basis. 
This is notably the case where the FIA processes personal data to allow academic or artistic expression. 
The FIA has explained in this notice where this is relevant to its motorsport related processing. 
FIA purposes of processing 
The FIA processes your data for the following purposes: 
Administering and managing Competitions and Championships, including selecting and authorising 
Competitors, manufacturers and suppliers, issuing motorsport licences and categorising Drivers, and 
associated health assessment (legitimate interests, healthcare processing, explicit consent) 
We collect and use your personal data so that we can carry out the FIA’s role as a Competition and 
Championship organiser, and as a governing body providing administrative assistance and 
management of Competitions and Championships it authorises but does not directly organise. This 
reflects our legitimate interest in administering and managing these Competitions and Championships, 
and the legitimate interest of other motorsport participants in ensuring these authorised Competitions 
and Championships can take place. This includes the collection of personal data to carry out due 
diligence in the selection and authorisation of Competitors, suppliers and manufacturers, to issue 
motorsport licences and categorise drivers, to issue media and other access accreditations, to allow 
Competitors and Drivers to register for specific Competitions and Championships, to appoint and 
manage relevant officials and to provide administrative support to Competitions and Championships 
such as issuing additional accreditation, liaising with third parties such as venues, Promoters or 
Organisers. This also includes our processing relating to checks of your fitness to attend an event, and 
arranging your travel and accommodation where required. It may also involve the taking of certain 
payments where required for entry or registration for a particular Competition or Championship or for 
obtaining a particular categorisation or accreditation. 
Where we collect any special category data, particularly safety data collected in accordance with the 
role of the FIA’s medical teams and medical delegates set out in the International Sporting Code, we 
rely upon our need to assess your health under the supervision of a healthcare professional where 
appropriate safeguards are in place. Where we receive your health data in connection with your fitness 
to attend an event, particularly as this relates to rules connected to Covid-19 protocols, we will typically 
process this to ensure the health and safety of other participants at these events. 
In some cases, if you provide us with special category data to provide administrative or other 
assistance, we seek your explicit consent to process this information to the extent required by 
applicable data protection laws. Failure to provide this information, or withdrawing your consent, may 
result in the revoking of a licence if this would mean you are not eligible for the relevant licence, or"
85,"result in the revoking of a licence if this would mean you are not eligible for the relevant licence, or 
may mean that the FIA is unable to provide appropriate assistance. 
We use your identification data, contact details, travel related data, motorsport participation data, 
motorsport performance data, financial data and safety data for this purpose. 
We share your information with Organisers, our officials, with appropriate authorities involved in the 
organisation of a Competition or Championship, with Promoters and with our suppliers for example 
our IT service providers who host relevant platforms, our professional advisors, and travel agencies 
involved in our administrative role. Where you are a Driver seeking a licence, we share information 
relating to your application with your team and representatives and your ASN. We also publish certain 
information, such as the names and categories of categorised Drivers and details of individuals who 
have had motorsport licences suspended. We also share information with law enforcement authorities"
86," 
 
if they have specific questions regarding the administration and management of Competitions and 
Championships. 
Carry out the FIA’s governance, integrity and disciplinary role (legitimate interests, establishing, 
exercising and defending legal claims, substantial public interest, explicit consent) 
We process personal data to carry out the FIA’s governance role in motorsport, including the collection 
and processing of information to confirm and enforce compliance with the FIA’s Statutes, International 
Sporting Code and the FIA’s Sporting, Technical and Financial Regulations, Judicial and Disciplinary 
Rules, and any other FIA rules and regulations that may apply from time to time. This includes the 
collection of information directly from you, and from third parties with whom you may interact in 
motorsport, such as your ASN, your employer or team or your relatives. We also receive information 
from a wider variety of third-party sources where this provides relevant information or intelligence, 
including the media, members of the public and other motorsport participants.  
We will use the data to carry out any necessary disciplinary and other legal processes, including 
appropriate investigations into possible breaches of our rules and regulations, to take decisions and 
enforce our decisions, and to publish details of the integrity decisions we take, including details of any 
bans we may impose. This processing is done to pursue our legitimate interest in maintaining the 
integrity of our sport, and the legitimate interest of other competitors to ensure motorsport is fair and 
free from improper influence or cheating.  
In some cases, where we collect special category data for this purpose, we may rely on an additional 
lawful basis to the extent required by or data protection laws. Some of our integrity processing relies 
on specific local laws in the substantial public interest, for example to justify the processing of anti-
doping data. We are also entitled to process special category data where we are seeking to establish, 
exercise and defend legal claims in the enforcement of our rules and regulations, including our Anti-
Doping Regulations. However, in some cases we may need to seek your explicit consent. Where we 
rely on this consent, you may refuse or withdraw this consent at any time, but this may limit your 
ability to participate in motorsport if this undermines our ability to ensure compliance with our 
regulations. 
The information we use for this purpose is your identification data, your contact details, your 
motorsport participation data, your motorsport performance data and your integrity and conduct 
data. It will also include your financial data where disclosure is required under the FIA’s Financial 
Regulations. 
We share your information with other participants in motorsport, including Organisers, 
Promoters,  with your representatives and advisors, with your ASN, your employer, with our officials, 
with appropriate authorities involved in the organisation of a Competition or Championship, and with 
our suppliers for example our IT service providers who host relevant platforms, our professional 
advisors including our legal counsel, forensic experts and auditors, and with the world at large if we 
choose to publish a decision. We share your information with other sports governing bodies and the 
World Anti-Doping Agency as required under the World Anti-Doping Code and our own International 
Sporting Code. We may discuss integrity matters with the media where appropriate. We also share 
information with law enforcement authorities and other regulatory authorities if they have specific 
questions regarding integrity matters Competitions and Championships, or where there is evidence of 
unlawful activity."

Ensuring the health and safety of all participants (legitimate interests, compliance with laws, vital 
interest, healthcare processing or laws in the substantial public interest) 
We collect information about you, including information about your health, for the purposes of 
ensuring the health and safety of all participants in motorsport, including yourself. This includes 
information collected from you in relevant medical forms. This will involve the processing of personal 
data to assess your health and safety whilst participating in a Competition, to ensure that you receive 
appropriate medical attention in the event of an incident during a Competition, and to ensure we carry 
out appropriate scrutiny of medical and rescue service providers and can carry investigations of health 
and safety related incidents during Competitions. We process much of this data on the basis of our 
legitimate interest of ensuring the health and safety of the participants in motorsport, and the interests 
of those participants both current and future. In some instances, we may be required to process data 
by law, where local laws require the maintaining of health and safety records or the engagement with"

public authorities conducting health and safety investigations. We may also use your personal data for 
the protection of your vital interests where, exceptionally, we need to share your data with medical 
professionals in the event of an incident. 
Where this data involves the processing of special category data, in particular your safety data, we 
process this to protect your vital interests, or as necessary to provide medical treatment under the 
supervision of a healthcare professional. If we are required to collect or share your data to comply with 
health and safety laws, we rely on these laws in the substantial public interest to justify our processing. 
The information we use for this purpose is your identification data, your contact details, your 
motorsport participation data, your motorsport performance data and your safety data. 
We share your information with appropriate medical professionals where this is needed for your 
diagnosis, treatment or care, including the local ASN doctor present at the relevant Competition. We 
will also share data with appropriate public authorities as required by local laws. We also share data 
with our advisors and third-party IT providers to the extent we need to retain information relation to 
your incident on our systems. 
Promoting motorsport, the FIA and our Competitions, merchandise and services (legitimate interest, 
contractual necessity) 
We will use information we collect and receive as part of your participation in Competitions, 
Championships and any connected media work for the purposes of our legitimate interest in promoting 
motorsport, the FIA, and our connected Competitions, Championships, merchandise, services and 
assets. If we have a specific agreement with you, giving us certain rights to use your personal data, we 
may instead process this on the basis of contractual necessity.  
The information we use for this purpose is your identification data, your contact details, your 
motorsport participation data, your motorsport performance data, your imagery and promotional data 
and, where necessary for performing a contract with you, your financial data. 
We share the information widely for the promotional purposes described above. This involves the 
sharing of data with specific media partners and broadcasters and commercial partners, but also 
involves the publication of your data. We also share data with our advisors and third-party IT providers. 
Conducting safety related research (consent) 
We collect and process data relating to incidents logged in the World Accident Database, for the 
purpose of analysis and compilation of findings. In accordance with the World Accident Database 
Guide, we rely on your explicit consent to process any identifiable information in the World Accident 
Database. We may, if you do not consent or later withdraw your consent, retain anonymised 
information relating to relevant incidents. We are a joint controller with ASNs for the details of the 
reports submitted to the World Accident Database. Affected data subjects can find out more about 
the split of responsibilities between the FIA and its joint controllers, and steps taken to ensure data 
minimisation, by reviewing the WADB Guide. 
The information we use for this purpose is your identification data, your motorsport participation data, 
your motorsport performance data and your safety data.  
We share your information within the World Accident Database with ASNs, our advisors and our 
provider who hosts and operates the WADB on behalf of the FIA. We also share your data with

motorsport. The FIA may in some circumstances seek personal data relating to diversity, inclusion and 
disability for monitoring purposes, based always on your consent. It may also collect equality, diversity 
and inclusion data for the purposes of providing inclusion related grants, including distribution of the 
Disabled Drivers Grants and similar initiatives operated by the FIA from time to time. 
The information we use for this purposes is your equality, diversity and inclusion data. This will always 
be collected with your consent. Where it is possible to ensure the anonymisation of your data for these 
purposes, the FIA will take such steps.  
We will not share your identifiable equality, diversity and inclusion data with third party controllers 
without your consent. We may share your information with our third-party suppliers to the extent that 
they are assisting us with relevant activities, such as administering a Disabled Driver Grant request. Any 
information used for diversity monitoring is likely to be shared with a specialist company that advises 
us on diversity, or that assists us with ensuring that responses are appropriately anonymised.

particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, 
or where we are using the data for direct marketing). 
These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about 
another person, where it would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us 
to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in 
keeping. Relevant exemptions are included in European, Swiss and UK data protection laws and under 
applicable member state laws. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when 
responding to any request you make.

APPENDIX 6 
 
SUPPLY OF POWER UNITS FOR THE 2021-2025 CHAMPIONSHIP SEASONS 
 
Preamble: The FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder remain entitled to decide jointly that this 
Appendix being withdrawn at any time if the number of Power Unit Manufacturers supplying power 
units in a Championship season is less than 3 (three). 
a. 
Any Power Unit Manufacturer wishing to supply power units to a Competitor must fulfil the 
obligations set out in section 1.1 of Appendix 4 of the Technical Regulations. 
b. 
No power unit may be used in a given Championship season unless the Power Unit Manufacturer 
supplying such power unit accepts and adheres to the following conditions. 
Each of the Power Unit Manufacturers of an homologated power unit must: 
1. 
provide the FIA, before 15 May (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the 
Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the season preceding that in which such power 
units are to be supplied, with the list of teams (clearly identifying the appointed 
“works/factory” team, if any) to which a supply agreement has been concluded for the 
given Championship season; 
2. 
if called upon to do so by the FIA before 1 June (or such other date as agreed in writing 
between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the season preceding that in 
which such power units were to be supplied, supply at least a number of teams (“T”) equal 
to the following equation: 
T = (111-A)/(B-C) 
- A = Total number of teams (including “works/factory” teams) having a supply agreement 
concluded for the given Championship season with a New Power Unit Manufacturer. 
- B = Total number of manufacturers of homologated Power Units for the given 
Championship season. 
- C = Total number of New Power Unit Manufacturers for the given Championship season. 
provided that if the result contains a fraction then the fraction shall count as a full team 
(e.g. 11 teams divided by 4 manufacturers = 2.75, each manufacturer must, if called 
upon to do so by the FIA, supply at least 3 teams). 
 
1 
 This figure will be reviewed each year as the “total number of entered teams” will not be known until 
November preceding the Championship season. The figure of 11 covers supply of 12 teams or less in compliance with 
the calculation rule. 
In doing so, the FIA will first allocate the power unit supply between the Power Unit 
Manufacturers that are supplying the fewest number of teams, provided that the teams 
without a supply agreement shall be allocated to the Power Unit Manufacturer(s) that 
supplies(supply) the lowest number of teams and so on. If there is more than one Power 
Unit Manufacturer supplying the fewest number of teams (i.e. in the same position) 
and/or more than one team requesting a supply the allocation between such Power Unit 
Manufacturers shall occur by ballot (which ballot shall be transparent and undertaken by 
the FIA in the presence of a representative of each of the Power Unit Manufacturer(s) and 
the new Customer Team concerned)."
101," 
 
Any such allocation made by the FIA will have to be formalised by a supply agreement 
with the concerned team by 1 August at the latest (or such other date as agreed in writing 
between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA). 
A New Power Unit Manufacturer will not be required to comply with this obligation of supply as 
set out above. 
c. 
The FIA shall be entitled to request a Power Unit Manufacturer to supply a team (“New 
Customer Team”) with a power unit under the terms of this Appendix except if, at the date set 
out in Article b) i) above: 
- 
Such team has entered into a supply agreement with a Power Unit Manufacturer for a 
given Championship season before the date set out in Article b) i) above, and 
- 
Such team has been granted a right, under a currently binding offer with a Power Unit 
Manufacturer, to be supplied with a power unit for such given Championship season. 
Moreover, such Power Unit Manufacturer shall only be required to supply a New Customer 
Team if the following cumulative conditions are met. If such conditions are not met, then the 
Power Unit Manufacturer may, at its sole and exclusive discretion, decline the request to supply 
such New Customer Team and the decline of such request shall not be deemed to be a breach 
of the terms set out in this Appendix (however Article c) cannot be applied or interpreted by the 
Power Unit Manufacturer in a way which would deprive the obligation of supply as referred to 
in Article b) above of any effect and/or that would prevent the FIA from making and enforcing 
the provisions set out in Article b) above. The Power Unit Manufacturer undertakes to exercise 
in good faith the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 to 11 below). The teams and the Power 
Unit Manufacturers remain free to negotiate the terms of the supply agreement, subject to the 
fall-back positions set out below which shall apply should a team and a Power Unit Manufacturer 
fail to reach an agreement, despite negotiating in good faith. 
1. 
For the purpose of this paragraph, supply contract only refers to the contract related to 
the FIA Supply Perimeter as per the Sporting and Technical Regulations and as set out in 
the relevant column of the first table in Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations. 
1.1. Any supply contract entered into with the New Customer Team must be on 
substantially the same terms as those entered into between the Power Unit 
Manufacturer and the other customer teams (other than its appointed 
“works/factory” team) to whom it already supplies a power unit at the date of the 
FIA request (“Existing Customer Team”), other than the Price as referred to in 
paragraph 8 below. In particular, the Power Unit Manufacturer may impose and the 
team cannot refuse to sign up to any terms which at least one of its other Existing 
Customer Teams has agreed to and the Power Unit Manufacturer may refuse and 
the team cannot request the inclusion of terms which are not included in the supply 
agreements with other Existing Customer Teams. 
1.2. In the event that a Power Unit Manufacturer has not supplied a power unit to any 
other Existing Customer Team, the Power Unit Manufacturer shall have the right to 
decide, at its sole and exclusive discretion, the payment terms and conditions 
(including the price of additional goods and services not included in the supply 
perimeter designated ‘EXC’ in the relevant column of the first table in Appendix 3 
of the Technical Regulations, but excluding the Price which shall be determined in"
102," 
 
compliance with the definition of Price below) applicable to the New Customer 
Team subject to the provisions of paragraph 8 below. 
1.3. In case of a dispute about the application or the interpretation of paragraph 1 
hereto, the FIA will be entitled to request copies of the contracts being entered into 
by the Power Unit Manufacturer with any customer team, provided that such 
contracts are not disclosed to any new Customer Team and subject to the FIA 
agreeing to comply with strict customary confidentiality obligations. 
2. 
The Power Unit Manufacturer shall determine, at its sole and exclusive discretion, the 
duration of the term of the power unit supply which: 
2.1. may not be lower than one Championship season; and 
2.2. shall not exceed three Championship seasons nor go beyond the end of the 2025 
Championship season, unless jointly agreed by the Power Unit Manufacturer and 
the New Customer Team 
3. 
The Power Unit Manufacturer shall determine, at its sole and exclusive discretion, 
whether the New Customer Team shall use the name of the Power Unit Manufacturer or 
the New Customer Team shall operate under a white label/unbranded way and, for this 
purpose, use a different name: 
3.1. The use of this different name shall always be agreed in advance by the Power Unit 
Manufacturer, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld; and 
3.2. In the event that the white label/unbranded supply is required without being 
requested by the New Customer Team, this supply will not incur additional fees for 
the New Customer Team except if the use of the power unit name leads to the 
conclusion of a commercial agreement between the New Customer Team and any 
third party. In that case, the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team 
shall enter into good faith negotiations and shall commonly agree on the fair and 
reasonable part of the revenues generated by the commercial agreement which 
could be considered as additional fees; 
3.3. In the event that the white label/unbranded supply is requested by the New 
Customer Team and agreed by the Power Unit Manufacturer, this supply may incur 
additional fees for the New Customer Team, such fees being determined at the sole 
and exclusive discretion of the Power Unit Manufacturer in a fair and reasonable 
manner. 
4. 
The New Customer Team shall provide a warranty that it has no binding contracts or 
option(s) in place with another power unit manufacturer for future supply of power units. 
The New Customer Team shall be required to terminate any such contracts or option(s) 
which do exist in so far as they conflict with any part of the period of the contract being 
entered into with the Power Unit Manufacturer. 
5. 
The New Customer Team shall not (unless the Power Unit Manufacturer agrees) be an 
Automotive Manufacturer or any of its affiliated companies which has been set up with 
the purpose amongst other things of participating in the Championship."
103," 
 
6. 
The New Customer Team shall not (unless the Power Unit Manufacturer agrees) have any 
sponsorship agreement in place with any entity, which is in competition with the Core 
Activities of an Automotive Manufacturer which are carried out by the Power Unit 
Manufacturer. 
7. 
The New Customer Team and/or any senior executives, directors or beneficial 
shareholders of the New Customer Team should not at any time (i) be listed or included 
in the official EU and/or US published sanction lists; (ii) have been convicted of any 
indictable criminal offence; (iii) have been convicted by any government or government 
agency in connection with fraud, money laundering, racketeering or terrorism activities; 
and/or (iv) have been declared bankrupt; and/or (v) have committed other identified 
action which, in the reasonable opinion of the Power Unit Manufacturer, harms the 
reputation of such Power Unit Manufacturer. This clause shall also reciprocally apply to 
the Power Unit Manufacturer. 
8. 
The Power Unit Supply Perimeter listed in the relevant column of the first table in 
Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations and designated ‘INC’ shall be supplied to New 
Customer Teams at the Price. 
The supply of additional goods or services not listed in Appendix 3 of the Technical 
Regulations (which shall be agreed between the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New 
Customer Team) shall incur additional charges, the amount of which shall be substantially 
the same as that applied by the Power Unit Manufacturer to its Existing Customer Team. 
In the event that a Power Unit Manufacturer has not supplied a power unit to any other 
Existing Customer Team, the Power Unit Manufacturer shall decide the price of the above-
mentioned additional goods and services based on the usages and practices generally 
recognised and respected in the market for the supply of parts and services in the 
Championship. 
9. 
The FIA shall confirm in writing to the Power Unit Manufacturer that, to the best of its 
knowledge, the New Customer Team, including its officers, directors and beneficial 
shareholders, has not been convicted of non-complying at all times with the FIA Code of 
Good Standing. 
10. 
Payment of the fees (directly or indirectly through a payment guarantee) under the supply 
contract for each season shall as a fall-back position (unless otherwise agreed between 
the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team) and, notwithstanding the 
terms of any contract with an Existing Customer Team or its own factory team, be made 
in four instalments: 
- 25% on the date of signature of the supply contract; 
- 25% on or before 30 October of the calendar year prior to the year of supply; 
- 30% before the start of the Championship season; and 
- The remaining 20% before the fifth Formula One Competition of the Championship. 
10.1. In case of any delayed payment for an amount greater than €100,000, the Power 
Unit Manufacturer shall send the New Customer Team a written notice of the 
breach, with a copy to the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder. Should the New 
Customer Team fail to resolve this breach to the satisfaction of the Power Unit"
104," 
 
Manufacturer (with or without the involvement of the FIA and the Commercial 
Rights Holder) within thirty days from the issuing of this notice the Power Unit 
Manufacturer shall be entitled to either terminate the supply contract immediately 
by serving written notice on the New Customer Team, with a copy to the FIA and 
the Commercial Rights Holder, or, suspend delivery of the power units to the New 
Customer Team. 
10.2. In case of breach of the obligation to deliver the power units and/or to supply 
additional goods or services to the New Customer Team pursuant to the supply 
agreement, such New Customer Team may send the Power Unit Manufacturer a 
written notice of the breach (but only in the event that the New Customer Team is 
not itself in breach of contract including for non-payment except if that non-
payment is justified by an alleged breach of the supply contract by the Power Unit 
Manufacturer), with a copy to the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder. Should 
the Power Unit Manufacturer fail to resolve this breach to the satisfaction of the 
New Customer Team (with or without the involvement of the FIA and the 
Commercial Rights Holder) within thirty days from the issuing of this notice the New 
Customer Team shall be entitled to suspend payment of the fees to the Power Unit 
Manufacturer. 
11. 
The New Customer Team and the Power Unit Manufacturer shall not, and will procure its 
affiliates and/or their respective senior executives, employees, directors and 
shareholders shall not take any action and/or make any omission, deceptive, misleading 
or disparaging or negative comments, which directly injures, damages or brings into 
disrepute the public reputation, goodwill or favourable name or image of the other party 
to the supply agreement. 
d. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 8.3 of the Sporting Regulations, unless agreed 
otherwise by the FIA, each of the manufacturers of an homologated power unit may not directly 
or indirectly supply power units for more than (T+1) teams, with T as defined in Article b). Such 
consent shall not be given if one or more of the other Power Unit Manufacturers are supplying 
less that T teams. 
e. 
Ceasing the supply of the power units. 
Any manufacturer of a homologated power unit wishing to cease the supply of power units must 
notify the FIA of its intention to do so no later than 1 January of the year preceding that in which 
such power units will no longer be supplied. 
f. 
In case of any alleged material breach or alleged material failure to comply with any of the 
obligations of the present Appendix, the FIA shall engage good faith and active discussions with 
the Power Unit Manufacturer and, in the absence of amicable solution within one month, be 
entitled to engage proceedings before the FIA International Tribunal against the Power Unit 
Manufacturer. In the case that, in accordance of the provisions of the Code and of the Judicial 
and Disciplinary Rules, the International Tribunal rules that the Power Unit Manufacturer has 
materially breached or materially failed to comply with Articles b) and/or d), the International 
Tribunal may impose on the Power Unit Manufacturer concerned, to the exclusion of any other 
sanction it may have the power to impose, a fine (the amount of which shall be no more than 
fifteen million euros and shall be determined, on a case by case basis, depending on the merits 
and circumstances of the applicable case)."

APPENDIX 7 
 
AERODYNAMIC TESTING RESTRICTIONS (ATR) 
 
The ATR, and the definitions and rules which will apply to aerodynamic testing, are as follows: 
1 
General conditions 
a. 
Restricted Aerodynamic testing is the testing by a Competitor or any Associate of a 
Competitor and/or by any contracted party of a Competitor or of any Associate of a 
Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for its own 
purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor in a test 
environment or numerical simulation of a representation of an F1 car or sub-component 
in order to measure, observe or infer any forces, displacements, pressures or air flow 
direction resulting directly or indirectly from the incident air flow. 
b. 
A three-dimensional representation of an F1 car or sub-component subject to Restricted 
Aerodynamic testing, defined either physically or digitally, will be considered for the 
purposes of this Article as a Restricted Aerodynamic Test Geometry (RATG) and save for 
where specifically permitted by this Article may not be added to, removed from, morphed 
or modified. In order to prevent Restricted Aerodynamic testing methodologies intended 
to subvert any limits on the number or nature of RATGs permitted under the ATR the 
following will apply: 
i. 
The purpose of a RATG is to allow aerodynamic assessment of a single new 
geometry, with aerodynamic dependency maintained throughout the simulated 
flow field. Any attempt to derive aerodynamically independent results for 
subcomponents of a RATG, either in the initial simulation or test, or by subsequent 
modification to the simulation or test conditions, is not permitted. Any attempt to 
use boundary conditions or similar to infer the effect of combining RATGs, without 
accruing a further RATG, is also not permitted. The use of boundary conditions 
cannot be exploited to simulate the effect on the fluid of a geometry which is 
different from the RATG in use. 
ii. 
If the representation contains external bodywork surfaces on both sides of the 
centre plane of the car these must be symmetrical about this plane with the 
exception of the wheel bodywork defined by Article 3.13 of the Technical 
Regulations. Minimal exceptions for parts directly associated with the cooling of 
the power unit, or changes of car attitude allowed under sections 3d (roll and steer) 
and 4 will be permitted. 
iii. 
Excluding permitted degrees of freedom for RWTT and changes in RCFDs, the 
substitution or replacement of any part of a RATG with a non-F1 car geometry, or 
the placement of any physical or computational boundary condition or solver 
setting, that simulates or attempts to simulate a modification to this RATG will be 
considered as a new RATG.  
iv. 
Sections (or sub-models) of a RATG which is used for RCFDs may be created by 
removing geometry from the parent RATG and placing boundary conditions of 
velocity or pressure profiles generated entirely from the same RATG to replicate"
107," 
 
the flow field resulting from the geometry that has been removed. This will not be 
considered as a new RATG provided any geometry within the section is identical to 
the parent RATG. Exceptionally where downstream portions of the RATG are 
removed these may be replaced with a single geometry approved for this purpose 
by the FIA. 
v. 
Sections (or sub-models) of a RATG used for RCFDs and created by removing 
geometry from a parent RATG may not be subsequently geometrically modified 
without being considered as a new RATG. Any boundary conditions of velocity or 
pressure profiles added in the process of creating the section (or sub-model) and 
used to replicate the flow field resulting from the geometry that has been removed 
may not be changed to boundary condition or profiles other than those generated 
from the parent RATG without being considered a new RATG. 
vi. 
If the representation contains surfaces that represent components of more than 
one F1 car then it shall be construed as the equivalent number of RATGs. Excluding 
permitted degrees of freedom for RWTT and changes in RCFDs, any subsequent 
modification of the relative position of the representations of F1 cars will be 
considered as new RATGs equivalent to the number of F1 car representations. 
vii. 
A baseline RATG is defined as a reference chosen from time to time that serves for 
comparison purposes.  
c. 
An Aerodynamic Testing Period (ATP) is a period of consecutive calendar weeks for the 
purposes of evaluation of the limits within this Article. As soon as one ATP ends a new one 
begins, with no gaps between them. 
There will be 6 ATPs in any year. The dates of these periods will be as follows: 
i. 
Period 1 will start on 1 January and finish at the end of week 9. 
ii. 
Periods 2, 3 and 5 will run for exactly 8 weeks each. 
iii. 
Period 4 will run for 10 weeks, comprising the Summer Factory Shutdown described 
in Article 24.1. 
iv. 
Period 6 will end on the 31 December. 
For the above definition, weeks are assumed to start on a Monday and week 1 is the first 
week of four days or more in the calendar year. 
In exceptional circumstances the FIA may revise these ATP at its absolute discretion in 
accordance with changes or events likely to affect these restrictions. 
d. 
In the context of this Article the words bodywork and sprung suspension will have the 
same definition as those provided by Article 3 and Article 10 of the Technical Regulations. 
Any data acquired during Restricted Aerodynamic testing may only be available to the 
Competitor that acquired it through use of the restricted aerodynamic testing available 
to it in accordance with the limits in this Article."
108," 
 
2 
Restricted Wind Tunnel Testing (RWTT) 
RWTT may only be carried out in wind tunnels which have been nominated by the Competitor 
to the FIA. Each Competitor may nominate only one wind tunnel for use in any one twelve month 
period and declare it in writing to the FIA. For a new entrant, the nomination must be made no 
later than 7 days after the date on which it officially becomes a Competitor. No re-nominations 
may be made for at least 12 months. Nominations should include the facility location, unique 
identification of the wind tunnel and the scale of model and RATG to be used. The FIA will 
consider, at its absolute discretion, earlier or temporary nominations if a wind tunnel already 
nominated by a Competitor suffers a long term failure or for the purpose of evaluating 
alternative wind tunnels. If a different facility is to be used or if the existing facility is changed or 
upgraded, other than for routine maintenance or replacement, then a new declaration must be 
submitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of submission of a testing 
period report whichever is earlier. 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, any RWTT carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of the 
Competitor by an Associate, a contracted party of the Competitor or of any Associate of the 
Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the Competitor or for its own purposes 
and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor must take place in the wind 
tunnel nominated by the Competitor. 
a. 
The limits for RWTT will be the number of runs of RWTT, the amount of wind tunnel 
occupancy time and wind tunnel wind-on time. 
i. 
During RWTT a single run will be deemed to commence each time the wind tunnel 
air speed rises above 5m/s and will end the first time thereafter it falls below 5m/s.  
ii. 
During RWTT, once the wind tunnel air speed rises above 5m/s the RATG must 
remain fixed and unmodified until the wind tunnel air speed returns below 1m/s.  
iii. 
Between runs of RWTT detail changes to the RATG and model are permitted. 
b. 
Wind on time is defined as the amount of time in hours summed over the ATP, where the 
wind tunnel air speed exceeds 15m/s for RWTT.  
c. 
During RWTT, the first shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the 
wind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s on a given calendar day, and will end at a time, 
declared by the Competitor, when the wind tunnel air speed falls below 5m/s on the same 
calendar day. A second shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the 
wind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s following the end of the first shift of occupancy (on 
the same calendar day) and will end, either when the wind tunnel air speed falls below 
5m/s for the last time on the same calendar day or, at the end of the calendar day in the 
event a run is still in progress. Only two shifts of occupancy may be carried out in any one 
calendar day. 
d. 
 In the event of a demonstrated wind tunnel failure or other Force Majeure the FIA will 
consider, at its absolute discretion, permitting additional occupancy to be used to 
compensate for that which is lost as a result. 
e. 
For the avoidance of doubt any RWTT performed for the Competitor by any Associate of 
the Competitor and/or by any contracted party of the Competitor or of any Associate of 
the Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the Competitor or for its own"
109," 
 
purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to the Competitor during an 
ATP will be subject to these same limits as if the tests were performed by the Competitor. 
3 
RWTT Permitted technology 
The following restrictions apply during RWTT: 
a. 
Only wind tunnels that use air at atmospheric pressure as the test fluid are permitted. 
Other than rotations of the RATG and model or ground plane about the yaw axis, designs 
which attempt to create curved flow conditions relative to the RATG are not permitted. 
For closed section wind tunnels adaption of vertical walls and the ceiling to improve air 
flow uniformity is permitted. Particle image velocimetry systems where the wind tunnel 
air transports a flow visualisation medium are permitted. 
b. 
No RWTT may be carried out using a scale model and RATG which is greater than 60% of 
full size neither may it be carried out at a wind tunnel air speed exceeding 50m/s 
measured relative to the scale model and RATG. Furthermore, during restricted wind 
tunnel testing the magnitude of the rate of change of the wind tunnel air speed measured 
relative to the scale model and RATG must be less than 4.5m/s². The rate of change of the 
wind tunnel air speed will be defined as the derivative of wind tunnel air speed and 
smoothed using a moving average filter, centred on each sample, of period 0.5 seconds 
during each wind tunnel air speed ramp up and ramp down phase. These phases are 
defined as the periods when the wind tunnel air speed is varying between 15m/s and 95% 
of the maximum wind tunnel air speed during a run. 
c. 
Only one model and RATG may be used per run. A maximum of two models may be used 
and a single model change made per Competitor per 24 hour period. For the avoidance 
of doubt, a model in this context is defined by its underlying spine, motors and sensors. 
In order to prevent testing which aims to develop for the 2026 season, from 1/12/2023 
until 1/1/2025 inclusive, RWTT may only be carried out using a scale model that 
substantially complies with the 2023, 2024 or 2025 F1 Technical Regulations. With the 
exception of dyno testing aimed to develop brake system components with minimal air 
ducting and provided such tests do not concurrently test (or in any way provide incidental 
data or knowledge on) the performance or endurance of parts or systems classified as 
bodywork, no wind tunnel testing may be carried out using car geometry partially or 
wholly compliant with and/or substantially derived from drafts and/or published versions 
of the 2026 F1 Technical Regulations or FIA proposed 2026 bodywork geometries and 
concepts. 
d. 
The only permitted degrees of freedom of the model and RATG during a run of RWTT are:  
i. 
Wheel rotation about the wheel axis 
ii. 
Changes of ride height and roll angle relative to the ground plane and associated 
articulation of the elements representing the RATG suspension 
iii. 
Changes of load applied to wheels through the elements representing the RATG 
suspension 
iv. 
Steering of the front wheels 
v. 
Changes of yaw angle relative to the incident air flow and/or ground plane"
110," 
 
vi. 
Simulation of differing exhaust flow 
vii. 
Adjustment of the flap angle of the front wing for a RATG which is substantially 
compliant with the 2025 Technical Regulations, or the flap angles of the adjustable 
regions of the Front Wing Profiles (as defined by C3.10.10 of the 2026 Technical 
Regulations) for a RATG which is substantially compliant with the 2026 Technical 
Regulations. 
viii. 
Adjustment of the incidence of the rearmost and uppermost element of the top 
rear wing for a RATG which is substantially compliant with the 2025 Technical 
Regulations, or the incidence of the RW Flap (as defined by C3.11.6 of the 2026 
Technical Regulations) for a RATG which is substantially compliant with the 2026 
Technical Regulations. 
ix. 
Adjustment or operation of sensors 
x. 
Application of flow visualisation liquids 
e. 
Changes of attitude of the model and RATG may not occur at a rate that requires changes 
of ride height at the front or rear axle centreline greater than the scale equivalent of 0.033 
m/s on the full size F1 car and/or rotation about the yaw or roll axes at a rate greater than 
1.0 deg./s. 
f. 
Where non-rigid wind tunnel tyres are used for RWTT these may only be produced by the 
appointed tyre supplier. Furthermore, devices that actively modify the shape of the tyre 
during RWTT other than as a result of vertical and lateral loads reacted at the contact 
patch are not permitted. Tyre pressure control is permitted but the complete wheel must 
contain only a single fixed internal gas volume. Systems which apply lubricant directly or 
indirectly to the wind tunnel tyres in order to reduce friction at the contact patches are 
permitted. 
4 
Restricted CFD (RCFD) simulations 
RCFDs are Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations by a Competitor or any Associate of 
a Competitor and/or by any contracted party of a Competitor or of any Associate of a Competitor 
or any external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for its own purposes and 
subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor of flows that are gaseous in the 
case of a F1 car and are not classified as power unit simulations. Any simulation of flows 
contained within the power unit cooling or lubrication systems, air, air/fuel mixtures, 
combustion process or products of combustion from a boundary commencing at the power 
unit’s atmospheric air intake ducts, passing through the power unit and finishing at the exit of 
the exhaust tailpipe will be classified as a power unit simulation. 
For the avoidance of doubt, if any CFD simulation (other than the power unit simulation defined 
above) reveals information to a Competitor or to an Associate of the Competitor whether 
directly, via a contracted party or via an external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for 
its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor, about flows 
that are gaseous on a F1 car then it is a RCFD simulation. For example, any CFD simulations 
conducted at scales other than 1:1 or using non-gaseous fluids are still RCFDs as they reveal 
information about flows that are gaseous on the full size F1 car."
111," 
 
a. 
A RCFDs refers to the pre-processing, the solver part or parts of the simulation process, 
and the post processing of the results of the simulation. 
i. 
Pre-processing refers to the meshing, decomposition and setup of the simulation. 
ii. 
Solver refers to the program or programs that compute the solution of the 
equations describing the flow including any extension of the simulation or 
simulations involving additional numerical computation (for example but not 
limited, to adjoint computation). 
iii. 
Post processing refers to the generation of representations of the flow solution that 
require numerical processing, for example but not limited to the computation of 
pressure coefficients, velocity, shear stress, flow streamlines or vorticity. 
Generation of videos or images displaying this information and any form or 
application of machine learning, deep learning or artificial intelligence (AI) based 
on simulation results is included in this definition. 
During or prior to RCFDs the only permitted changes to the RATG are its attitude (ride 
height, roll, yaw, steer and associated tyre shape or contact patch) and front wing flap 
angle or rear wing rearmost and uppermost element incidence for a RATG which is 
substantially compliant with the 2025 Technical Regulations, or the flap angles of the 
adjustable regions of the Front Wing Profiles (as defined by C3.10.10 of the 2026 Technical 
Regulations) and incidence of the RW Flap (as defined by C3.11.6 of the 2026 Technical 
Regulations) for a RATG which is substantially compliant with the 2026 Technical 
Regulations. Furthermore, if a change in attitude causes an intersection between the Floor 
Bodywork and/or plank assembly and simulated ground plane, a local trim will be 
permitted to the Floor Bodywork and/or plank assembly only.  Any trim must be the 
minimum required to remove the intersection, must be visible from below and must lie 
between XF=400 and XR=0. For avoidance of doubt, should any other changes be made 
to the RATG during any stage or pause in process ii. above (such as a morphing, or the 
addition or substitution of any boundary condition with the intent to replicate an 
alternative geometry) a new RATG must be counted each time a change occurs. 
Changes to parts classified as LTC, TRC or OSC and contained entirely within the drum 
volume defined by article 3.13.2 and the scoop defined by article 3.13.3 of the Technical 
Regulations and outboard of YW=0 and only for the purpose of developing cooling are 
permitted.  
Modifications to surface and volume mesh resolution and type provided they have the 
purpose of resolving and solving exactly the same geometry to a tolerance of 0.5mm 
scaled to a 1:1 car, as well as the extent of the far field domain, changing the simulation 
between a wind tunnel or track environment, initialisation, boundary conditions, solver 
settings and methodology are allowed. None of these modifications may be exploited to 
circumvent the requirements of the ATR by otherwise creating the effect of a change to 
the RATG. For the purposes of the ATR “far field” will be considered to be greater than 
1m from any part of the F1 car or sub-component scaled to a 1:1 car. 
A RATG may be used in RCFDs with geometry on only one side of the car centre plane, 
using a symmetric boundary condition on that plane, or with geometry on both sides of"
112," 
 
the car centre plane, subject to the geometric symmetry requirements of section 1.b.ii. 
Changing between these two representations will not be considered a new RATG. 
The addition of non-gaseous computational regions (including but not limited to coupled 
structural solver elements and conjugate heat transfer solid models) are not considered 
changes to the RATG provided that no geometric changes to the RATG itself take place 
during or prior to RCFDs.  
The solver part or parts of all RCFDs must only be carried out using a compute resource 
that contains a set of homogeneous processing units and that has been nominated by the 
Competitor to the FIA. Each Competitor must declare to the FIA in writing the compute 
resources that are employed for the purpose of the solver part or parts of RCFD 
simulations. Floating, fixed point and integer operations from the solver part or parts of 
RCFD simulations must only run on and may not be offloaded from these CPU cores. From 
1st January 2028 onwards, regulation will be introduced that will allow the use of GPU 
cores. 
b. 
The declaration of a compute resource by the Competitor to the FIA must include: 
i. 
The computer or cluster identification, manufacturer, model and location and the 
manufacturer, name and full unique model number of the Processing Units. 
ii. 
Number of processing unit cores in the compute resource. 
iii. 
Processor speed at which each Processing Unit is configured to run at 100% CPU 
load (CCF). In order to prevent deliberate underclocking this value may not be lower 
than the standard or base clock frequency given by the Manufacturer’s 
specification. 
Any specification of compute resource declared must be available on a non-exclusive basis 
to all Competitors. 
c. 
If the compute resource is changed or upgraded then a new declaration must be 
submitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of submission of a 
testing period report whichever is earlier. Such changes might include, but are not limited 
to, a change of the hardware specification, addition or removal of processing units or 
change of location of any part of the compute resource. 
d. 
The amount of compute resource used for the solve part or parts of all RCFDs shall be 
measured in Mega Allocation Unit hours (MAUh) and will be calculated as follows. 
AUh = (NCU * NSS * CCF) / 3600 
Where: 
AUh = The total number of Unit hours allocated to a CFD solver run. An Allocation 
Unit hour represents the use of a unit of resource allocation for one hour (and 1 x 
MAUh = 1,000,000 x AUh). An Allocation Unit hour is equivalent to a core hour on 
a physical CPU core. 
CCF = Peak Processing Unit clock frequency in GigaHertz achieved during the CFD 
solver run. This will be the peak frequency theoretically achievable during the 
run based on one of the following:"
113," 
 
i) The standard or base clock frequency value from the Processing Unit 
Manufacturer’s specification (if overclocking or enhanced modes are not used 
in the run). 
ii) The maximum “turbo”, “HPC” or other enhanced mode frequency value. 
iii) The maximum overclocked frequency value. 
NCU = Number of Processing Unit cores used for the solver run. The effects of multi-
threading, where simultaneous threads run on the same physical core will be 
ignored. 
NSS = Number of solver wall clock seconds elapsed during the run. Message passing 
time during calculation must also be included. 
All information required for auditing of this calculation must be present in the output from 
the run including the CCF value. 
e. 
Non-RCFDs can be made by a Competitor provided that:  
i. 
They have been requested by the FIA and use a previously-simulated RATG, and 
that these simulations are run as specified by the FIA and the results made available 
to the FIA; or 
ii. 
They use a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD more than 30 months 
ago and are for the purpose of optimising CFD methodology; or 
iii. 
They use an FIA approved CAD geometry provided to all Competitors on an 
equitable and transparent basis and are for the purpose of optimising CFD 
methodology; or  
iv. 
Subject to v. and for the sole purpose of contributing toward the development of 
future regulations only, they use an FIA approved geometry provided for this 
purpose or as a basis for modification a unique RATG which has been simulated in 
CFD less than 30 months ago.  
v. 
Non-RCFDs for future regulations are conditional on the full list and details of all 
such Non-RCFDs (including but not limited to geometries, attitudes, flow 
conditions) being approved by the FIA in advance of any work being carried out and 
full reports of the results being made available to all Competitors, via the FIA, with 
no team-specific Intellectual Property shared. 
vi. 
They are carried out using only the nominated compute resources described above. 
vii. 
The unique RATG or FIA approved geometry is not changed, added to, removed 
from, morphed or modified. Exceptions to this are permitted for the replacement 
of elements of the RATG or FIA approved geometry, with boundary conditions for 
the purposes of developing CFD sub-modelling methodology provided it does not 
attempt to simulate a modification to this RATG or FIA approved geometry, or 
where geometry changes are explicitly permitted and pre-approved by the FIA for 
the development of future regulations.  
For the avoidance of doubt, any Non-RCFDs carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of 
the Competitor by an Associate, a contracted party of the Competitor or of any Associate 
of the Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the Competitor or for its

own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor must 
also meet all the requirements set out in 4.e above. 
In order to prevent CFD simulations which aim to develop for the 2026 season, from 
1/12/2023 until 1/1/2025 inclusive, RCFDs may only be carried out using geometries that 
substantially comply with the 2021-2025 F1 Technical Regulations. Except for the sole 
purpose of the development of brake system components and associated test rigs but 
excluding any development of parts or systems classified as bodywork, no RCFD 
simulations may be carried out using car geometry partially or wholly compliant with 
and/or substantially derived from drafts and/or published versions of the 2026 F1 
Technical Regulations or FIA proposed 2026 bodywork geometries and concepts. 
f. 
In the case of Non-RCFDs using a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD more 
than 30 months ago or Non-RCFDs using an FIA approved geometry, geometry 
manipulations (e.g. in CAD clean-up or meshing software) having the sole purpose of 
reproducing exactly the same geometry previously solved in CFD or represented in the 
FIA approved CAD model or list (to a tolerance of 1.5mm scaled to a 1:1 car) are allowed. 
This tolerance is introduced only to allow for unintentional and incidental changes in 
geometry detail caused by the revisions in software and process. For the avoidance of 
doubt, static changes to car attitude (ride height, roll, yaw, steer and associated tyre 
shape or contact patch) and front wing flap angle or rear wing rearmost and uppermost 
element incidence (for a RATG which is substantially compliant with the 2025 Technical 
Regulations) are permitted, as are changes to the flap angles of the adjustable regions of 
the Front Wing Profiles (as defined by C3.10.10 of the 2026 Technical Regulations) and 
incidence of the RW Flap (as defined by C3.11.6 of the 2026 Technical Regulations) for a 
RATG which is substantially compliant with the 2026 Technical Regulations. Furthermore, 
when using an FIA approved geometry the FIA may approve additional incidence changes 
to bodywork (“active aerodynamics”) which will be clearly identified within the FIA 
approved CAD files and associated documentation. 
g. 
Modifications to surface and volume mesh resolution and type as well as the extent of 
the far field domain including changing the simulation between a wind tunnel or track 
environment, are allowed. 
h. 
The limits for RCFDs will be revised periodically, to take account of advances in CFD 
simulations.

Exceptions to the Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR) 
a. 
Any aerodynamic test conducted by an F1 car at any Competition or any aerodynamic test 
conducted by an F1 car during and at track testing as defined by Article 10 of the Sporting 
Regulations will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing. 
b. 
Wind tunnel testing solely for the development of power unit heat exchangers that reject 
heat to air, or the running of the power unit from a boundary commencing at the power 
unit air intake ducts, passing through the power unit and finishing at the exit of the 
exhaust tailpipe will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing, provided that 
there is no direct or indirect measurement of aerodynamic force during the test. In this 
context, pressure and flow measurements within a duct shall not be considered to be 
measurements of aerodynamic force."

c. 
Steady state and dynamic engine dynamometer work with an F1 car or subcomponent 
will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing provided that:  
i. 
The bodywork used in the test has no front wing assembly as described in Article 
3.9 of the Technical Regulations) or rear wing assembly (described in Article 3.10 of 
the Technical Regulations) present. 
ii. 
No devices designed to measure directly, or indirectly aerodynamic forces or flow 
field characteristics are installed in the facility used. 
iii. 
No sensor installed on the car or subcomponent which are capable of measuring 
displacements, pressures or air flow direction of the external airstream resulting 
directly or indirectly from the incident air flow may be logged. Logging files have to 
be available, if required, during the independent audit inspection. 
iv. 
The gas flow exiting from the exhaust system is ducted away from the testing area 
before impacting on any bodywork component (other than the exhaust itself). 
d. 
Wind tunnel testing solely for the development of brake systems (Article 11 of the 
Technical Regulations), wheels and tyres (Article 10 of the Technical Regulations), and for 
development and calibration of pressure sensing instrumentation (such as pitot tubes, 
multi-directional probes and Kiel tubes), provided such tests do not concurrently test, or 
in any way provide incidental data or knowledge on, the performance or endurance of 
parts or systems classified as bodywork will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic 
testing. Parts classified as wheel bodywork may be fitted for Wind tunnel testing solely 
for the development of brake systems, wheels and tyres. 
e. 
Wind tunnel testing that uses a RATG for the sole purpose of the conditioning of wind 
tunnel infrastructure or the development of wind tunnel infrastructure (including all of its 
sub-systems such as rolling road, model motion system, force balance, wind tunnel model 
spine, sensors etc.) and methodology may be performed and will not count towards the 
accumulation of runs, wind-on time, and occupancy subject to the testing complying with 
either of the following restrictions: 
i. 
The front wing group and the rear wing group of the RATG must be removed from 
the wind tunnel for the duration of the testing. Alternatively, either one of or both 
the wing groups may be retained on the model, but each that remains must be 
fitted with a bluff cover that has been approved for this purpose by the FIA. The 
front and rear wing groups will be considered to be bodywork described by Articles 
3.9 and 3.10 of the 2025 Technical Regulations respectively for a RATG which is 
substantially compliant with the 2025 Technical Regulations, or the bodywork 
described by Articles C3.10 and C3.11 of the 2026 Technical Regulations 
respectively for a RATG which is substantially compliant with the 2026 Technical 
Regulations. 
ii. 
A RATG is used which is more than 12 months old, or represents an FIA approved 
CAD geometry provided for this purpose and that no modification is made to this 
previously tested RATG or FIA approved geometry. 
During audit Competitors may be requested to demonstrate compliance of any such testing 
through the production of supporting data."
118," 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, any wind tunnel testing to develop bodywork parts other than as 
referred to above even without aerodynamic force measurement is within the definition of 
Restricted Aerodynamic testing.

Limits, Reporting, Inspection and Audit 
a. 
The limits for RWTT and RCFDs are as set out in the tables below where: 
i. 
P is the Competitor’s final position in the Constructors’ Championship of the 
previous year for the first 3 Aerodynamic Testing Periods, or the position in the 
current Constructors’ Championship at the end of the last day of the third 
Aerodynamic Testing Period, for the last 3 Aerodynamic Testing Periods. 
ii. 
C is the coefficient (expressed in percentage form) by which the various parameters 
need to be multiplied in order to obtain the individual RWTT and RCFD limits for 
each Competitor. For RWTT Runs and RATGs the result of the multiplication will be 
rounded up to the nearest integer.

b. 
In the event that a change in ATR limits is applicable to a Competitor after the start of an 
ATP, the change will be applied pro-rata according to the time remaining in the ATP during 
which the change occurs. At its absolute discretion and following a request from the 
Competitor the FIA may permit over or under use of available Restricted Aerodynamic 
testing in the ATP during which the change occurred to be amortised or absorbed over 
the subsequent ATP. 
c. 
In the event that the Championship order established at the end of the last day of the 3rd 
Aerodynamic Testing Period is subsequently changed following revisions to the results of 
a Competition or Competitions and therefore the limits applicable to certain Competitors 
change, the FIA will require Competitors to adjust Restricted Aerodynamic testing in order 
to comply with the revised limits from the start of the next ATP. At its absolute discretion 
the FIA may require or permit over or under use of available Restricted Aerodynamic 
testing in the ATP during which the change occurred to be amortised or absorbed before 
the end of the year.

d. 
Each Competitor shall report to the FIA details of its RWTT and RCFDs for the preceding 
ATP within 14 days of the end of that ATP. The data must be provided in the exact format 
specified by the FIA, details of which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and 
Sporting Regulations. 
e. 
Digital wind tunnel image files in colour and with sufficient unobstructed field of view of 
the wind tunnel working section to include the entire model must be recorded, referenced 
to other data collected and a copy saved including a unique time stamp to at least one 
second accuracy for the start of each individual run. 
Should the FIA wish to access the images for inspection at any time they must be of adequate 
quality such that it is possible to use them to verify, for example, whether the front wing group 
(as described in Article 3.9 of the Technical Regulations) and rear wing group (as described in 
Article 3.10 of the Technical Regulations) are fitted. In the case of other runs deemed to be non-
RWTT in the context of this Article, for example using a RATG greater than 12 months old, or 
using the approved wing covers, the images must also provide a clear visual reference to assist 
in verifying this aspect of the test. 
 
f. 
In order to permit RCFDs to continue across the end of an ATP an RATG that is used for 
solve or solve parts of RCFDs in an ATP may be used in any subsequent ATP subject to the 
requirements of Sections 1 and 4 above, without being counted again. 
g. 
The complete surface mesh subject to the solver part or parts of each RCFD and any non-
RCFD that includes a representation of an F1 car must be recorded and stored for a period 
of at least 24 months or until an earlier deletion is agreed by the FIA. It must be referenced 
to all data relating to the RCFDs or non-RCFDs including but not limited to solution 
monitoring data and any boundary condition of velocity and pressure profiles applied to 
the far field or domain boundaries and clearly and uniquely identifiable. It must be 
possible from these data to verify any changes made to the RATG and identify each 
individual flow solution generated using it. It must be possible to trace RCFDs used to 
generate velocity or pressure profiles applied as boundary conditions in subsequent 
sections or sub-models of the RATG that have not been counted as new RATGs. 
h. 
A description correct at the start of the simulation or test of each RATG that is subject to 
RWTT or that is counted against the maximum permitted new RATGs for RCFDs in any ATP 
must be recorded with a clear description such that it is possible to easily identify the 
nature of the changes under evaluation. These descriptions will form part of the report 
required by Section 6. d) above. 
i. 
In order to verify the Restricted Aerodynamic testing facilities employed by the 
Competitors and as a means of assuring common application of the restrictions set out in 
this Article, the FIA will arrange for independent benchmarking inspections of both wind 
tunnel and CFD activities to be carried out from time to time. Recommendations arising 
from these inspections will be incorporated into this Article. 
j. 
Failure to comply with the limits of the ATR by a Competitor will result in a reduction of 
the limits that will apply to subsequent ATP or ATPs for that Competitor at the FIA’s 
absolute discretion but by a minimum reduction equivalent to 10 multiples of the amount 
by which the relevant limit or limits were exceeded without prejudice to further 
appropriate action. (For example, if a Competitor carries out 325 restricted wind tunnel"
120," 
 
runs against a maximum of 320 in an ATP, that Competitor shall only be permitted to 
make 270 restricted wind tunnel runs during the next ATP). 
7 
Movement of personnel 
No Competitor may use movement of personnel involved in the development, design or testing 
of aerodynamic surfaces (whether employee, consultant, contractor, secondee or any other 
type of permanent or temporary personnel) with another Competitor, either directly or via an 
external entity, for the purpose of circumventing the requirements of this Article. In order that 
the FIA may be satisfied that any such movement of staff is compliant with this Article, each 
Competitor must inform the FIA of all relevant staff movements at the end of each ATP using 
the template which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations and 
must demonstrate that they have implemented all reasonable measures to avoid the disclosure 
of information, data or designs between the Competitors involved."

This base dyno testing limitations includes the provision for any testing for a team for a calendar 
year (Including but not limited to gearbox, car systems, fuel and engine oil testing).  
Should a PU supplier provide PU’s for use during the 2022-25 Championships to other customer 
Competitors who design any of their own car components as listed below or who have their own 
fuel or oil supplier, a quota of 30 additional operation hours will be allocated per calendar year 
and per additional customer Competitor. This quota to be used only during a maximum of six 
separate periods of up to three weeks each for the testing of Current generation PU for any 
combination of the components subject to agreement with the PU supplier and the FIA: 
o Gearbox and/or gearbox case 
o Exhaust system up to the turbine inlet and/or beyond turbine exit and WG exit 
o Heat exchangers, their associated accessories and coolant header tanks 
o Clutch and clutch actuation system between the PU and the gearbox 
o Fuel system operating at less than 10 barG and its associated accessories 
o Hydraulic system and hydraulic heat exchangers, other than servo valve(s) and actuator(s) 
for PU control 
These additional operation hours will not be included in the sum of the operational hours stated 
in Appendix 8 Item 1a) ‘Sole Purpose of Testing Power Units for Performance and Reliability’ and 
will be specifically and exclusively for the following: 
o Approving the items listed  
o and / or for the sole purpose of the evaluation of the effects of the car components defined 
on a Power Train Test Bench on Power Unit performance and reliability. 
Should an additional customer team requests to its PU supplier and the FIA to be able to run 
with a fuel and/or an engine oil different to the one(s) that is(are) already homologated for use 
with their engine; and should the PU supplier considers that this fuel and/or engine oil is(are) 
ready to be used in race Competitions, the PU supplier may request approval of this(ese) fuel 
and/or engine oil. Once this(ese) fuel and/or engine oil are approved, an extra allocation of 30 
operation hours for the testing of Current generation PU may be given by the FIA specifically 
and exclusively for endurance validation of this(ese) fuel and/or engine oil. This extra allocation 
can only happen a maximum of 2 times per championship season in 2022 and 1 time per 
championship season from 2023 onwards. 
In all cases, these additional hours must be jointly declared to FIA by the PU supplier and the 
customer team. 
Additional occupancy hours to support the additional operation hours above will be granted at 
a ratio of 8:1 
e)  
Exceptions: 
ICE motoring, i.e., any activity done on a PUTB with no ignition and not showing any positive 
torque for the whole recorded activity, will not be counted towards the Operation or Occupancy

ERS dyno limitations 
a)  
Definitions: 
- ERS Test Bench: An ERS test bench is either an ES test bench, a Power Electronics test bench 
and/or an MGU test bench.  
- ES Test Bench : Test bench facility cell where a complete ES representative of a Formula One ES 
may be tested. This excludes test bench falling into the Engine test bench definition. 
- MGU Test Bench: Test bench facility cell where an MGU (MGU-H or MGU-K) representative of a 
Formula One part can be tested. This excludes test bench falling into the Engine test bench 
definition. 
- Power Electronics Test Bench: Test bench facility cell where an ERS Control Unit, representative 
of a Formula One part can be tested. This excludes test bench falling into the Engine test bench 
definition. 
- Test Bench Occupancy Hours: Time interval between first work in the bench and last work in the 
bench in any 24 hours calendar day. Work can be organized in shifts but only two shifts of 
occupancy may be carried out in any one calendar day. The first shift of occupancy will be 
deemed to commence the first time the current in or out of the tested system is above 10 Amp 
or when MGU speed is above 1000 rpm on a given calendar day, or at the start of the calendar 
day if these criteria are already met, and will end at a time, declared by the competitor, when 
these criteria are no more met on the same calendar day. A second shift of occupancy will be 
deemed to commence the first time the current in or out of the tested system is above 10 Amp 
or when MGU speed is above 1000 rpm following the end of the first shift of occupancy (on the 
same calendar day) and will end, either when these criteria are no more met for the last time 
on the same calendar day or, at the end of the calendar day in the event a run is still in progress 
- Test Bench Operation Hours: Time with current in or out of the tested system above 10 Amps or 
time with MGU speed above 1000 rpm. 
- Restricted ERS Testing: Restricted ERS Testing is any testing by a PU manufacturer, or any Related 
Party of that PU manufacturer, or any agent or sub-contractor of the PU manufacturer or any of 
its Related Parties, in a test environment of a complete or incomplete F1 ERS system, but always 
including at least 3 out of 5 of the main ERS components (ES, CU-H, CU-K, MGU-K, MGU-H) in 
order to measure any parameters related to the function of this assembly. Testing falling into 
the scope of the Engine dyno limitation are outside this restriction. Any sign off test or end of 
line test are included. 
- Annual shutdown: Period when no occupancy hours nor operations hours may be incremented. 
b)  
Facility Limitations: 
- Allowed ES Test Benches are: 
Any bench where an ES can be installed and run. 
This includes the benches where other PU elements can be tested as, for example, the engine.  
ES stationary in space."
127," 
 
- Allowed MGU Test Benches are: 
Any bench where an MGU can be installed and run. 
This includes the benches where other PU elements can be tested as, for example, the engine.  
MGU stationary in space, installed with horizontal shaft. 
MGU-K and MGU-H can be tested simultaneously but no more than one MGU of the same type 
(ie: MGU-K or MGU-H) can be tested at the same time. 
It is permissible to use MGU-K and MGU-H hardware that is at least two years old within the test 
bench solely as a dynamometers, and these may be controlled using CU’s that are also at least 
two years old. These devices must be declared to the FIA 
No chassis force actuators. 
- Allowed Power Electronics Test Benches are: 
Any bench where an ERS Control Unit it can be installed and run. 
This includes the benches where other PU elements can be tested as, for example, the engine.  
CU stationary in space 
c)  
Implementation: 
- Yearly limit divided into 10 weeks periods. 
- The time limit for a 10 weeks period may be exceeded twice by up to 20% without being in 
breach if the time recorded for the complete year remains within the yearly limit. 
- One single limit for all bench types (One number of test benches limit, One Occupancy hour 
limit, one Operation hour limit). 
- Time monitoring based on declaration based on approved software measurement (Certified 
software application time counter, developed by the ERS test bed automation supplier.) 
- Number of ERS Test Bench:  
o Before the 1st of December of the preceding year: Declaration from the PU supplier of the 
identities (Name, description, location) of ERS test benches to be used in a calendar year. 
This includes any bench whatever their location, ownership or duration of use during the 
calendar year. 
o Should a Manufacturer suffer a demonstrated long-term failure of a bench or other Force 
Majeure the FIA will consider at its absolute discretion changes of nomination or temporary 
nomination. 
o No later than 2 weeks after the end of each 10 week period: 
 Designation by the PU supplier of the benches that were used for the period 
 For Restricted Current generation ERS testing no limitation of the number of changes of 
bench type per calendar year but all benches must be among the ones declared at the 
start of the year. 
o In order to check on the hardware employed by the PU manufacturers and as a mean of 
assuring common application of the restrictions set out, the FIA will arrange for independent 
benchmarking inspections of dynos activities to be carried out from time to time. 
o Any of the ERS test benches declared above may also be used for testing any element of an 
ERS constructed in order to comply with the 2026 Technical Regulations once officially"
128," 
 
ratified or, in the absence of such regulations, with the agreed technical provisions of the 
2026 Championship, as determined by the FIA. 
- Test bench occupancy: 
o Sum of each individual bench occupancy hours: 
Total Occupancy hours: OCH 
OCH = ෍𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁
𝑛𝑛=𝑁𝑁
𝑛𝑛=1
 
With: 
• N = Number of test benches 
• NOCHn= Number of occupancy hours during the period for bench number n 
o Declaration 14 days after each 10 weeks period from PU manufacturers signed by top 
management.  
o PU manufacturers must keep records of bench tests until 1 month after the end of the 
calendar year 
- Test Bench Operation Hours:  
o Sum of each individual bench operation hours.  
Total Operation hours: OPH 
OPH = ෍𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁
𝑛𝑛=𝑁𝑁
𝑛𝑛=1
 
With: 
• N = Number of test benches 
• NOPHn= Number of operation hours during the period for bench number n 
o Declaration 14 days after each 10 weeks period from PU manufacturers signed by top 
management 
o PU manufacturers must keep records of bench tests until 1 month after the end of the 
calendar year
