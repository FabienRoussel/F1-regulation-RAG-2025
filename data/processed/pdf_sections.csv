28)  POWER UNIT USAGE,"28.1  The only power unit that may be used at a Competition during the 2022-2025 Championship  seasons is a power unit which is constituted only of elements that were in conformity, at the  date they were introduced in the race pool, with the latest submitted and approved  homologation dossier as defined in Appendix 4 of the Technical Regulations.  28.2  Unless a driver drives for more than one (1) Competitor (see Article 28.4 below), and subject to  the additions described below, each driver may use no more than four (4) engines (ICE), four (4)  motor generator units-heat (MGU-H), four (4) turbochargers (TC), two (2) energy stores (ES),  two (2) control electronics (CE), four (4) motor generator units-kinetic (MGU-K) and eight (8) of  each of the four (4) elements constituting a set of Engine exhaust systems during a  Championship. For the purpose of this article a set of Engine exhaust systems is deemed to  comprise the following four (4) elements: primaries LHS, primaries RHS, secondary LHS and  secondary RHS.  28.3  Should a driver use more Power Unit elements than the numbers prescribed in Article 28.2 of  any one of the elements during a Championship, a grid place penalty for the race will be imposed  upon him at the first Competition during which each additional element is used. Penalties will  be applied according to the following table and will be cumulative:  a)  The first time an additional element of each type is used: Ten (10) grid place penalty for  the race.  b)  The next times an additional element of each type is used: Five (5) grid place penalty for  the race.  Any of the seven (7) elements will be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing  transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane.  During any single Competition, if a driver introduces more than one of the same Power Unit  element which is subject to penalties, only the last element fitted may be used at subsequent  Competitions without further penalty.  28.4  If a driver is replaced at any time during the Championship his replacement will be deemed to  be the original driver for the purposes of assessing Power Unit usage.  28.5  After consultation with the relevant Power Unit Manufacturer the FIA will attach seals to each  of the relevant elements of the Power Unit prior to them being used for the first time at a  Competition in order to ensure that no significant parts can be rebuilt or replaced. Exhaust  elements defined in Article 28.2 above should be permanently and uniquely marked, which is  then clearly visible directly or using an optical device in a timely manner when a Power Unit is  fitted to a chassis.  Within two (2) hours of the end of the post-race Parc Fermé additional seals will be applied to  all used power unit elements in order to ensure that they cannot be run or dismantled between  Competitions. The sealing method must be agreed with the Technical Delegate.  Upon request to the FIA, these additional seals will be removed twenty-four (24) hours before  the scheduled start of P1 at the next Competition at which the Power Unit elements are  required. All such Power Unit elements must remain within the Competitor’s designated garage"

The declaration form template will be provided by the FIA.  31.2  Unless prior written permission has been granted by the Technical Delegate, any Competitor  who do not keep to these time limits will be referred to the stewards.   31.3  No car may take part in the Competition until the declaration described in Article 31.1 has been  submitted, and the Technical Delegate has confirmed to the Competitor that he is satisfied it  has been fully and correctly completed.  31.4  Any Competitor whose car has a change of survival cell after initial scrutineering (see Article  31.1) must complete a new declaration for approval by the Technical Delegate. However:  a)  At each Competition where a sprint session is not scheduled, any such car scrutineered  after the start of P1 may not be used until the start of P3 and any such car scrutineered  after the start of P3 may not be used until the pit exit is opened before the race, as  described in Article 44.1.   b)  At each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled, any such car scrutineered after  the start of P1 may not be used until the pit exit is opened before the sprint session, as  described in Article 43.2.   31.5  The scrutineers may:    a)  Check the eligibility of a car or of a Competitor at any time during a Competition.      This includes and is not limited to; a period of up to one hour, after the covers are fitted  following a sprint qualifying or qualifying session according to Article 40.6, and after the  covers are removed before the scheduled start of the formation lap for the sprint  according to Article 40.7 or the race according to Article 40.8, and immediately after the  race.    b)  Require a car to be dismantled by the Competitor to make sure that the conditions of  eligibility or conformity are fully satisfied.    c)  Require a Competitor to pay the reasonable expenses which exercise of the powers  mentioned in this Article may entail.    d)  Require a Competitor to supply them with such parts or samples as they may deem  necessary.  31.6  The Race Director or the clerk of the course may require that any car involved in an accident be  stopped and checked.  31.7  Checks and scrutineering shall be carried out by duly appointed officials who shall also be  responsible for the operation of the parc fermé and who alone are authorised to give  instructions to the Competitors."
32)  CHANGES OF DRIVER,"32.1  During a Championship each Competitor will be permitted to use a maximum of four (4) drivers  in races.  32.2  Provided any change proposed after the end of initial scrutineering receives the consent of the  stewards, a change of driver may be made:  a)  At each Competition where a sprint session is not scheduled, at any time before the start  of the qualifying session.  b)  At each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled, at any time before the start of  the sprint qualifying session for a driver who will participate in the sprint session, or at  any time before the start of the qualifying session for a driver who will participate in the  race.  Additional changes for reasons of force majeure will be considered separately.  32.3  Any new driver may score points in the Championship.  32.4  In addition to the provisions of Article 32.1, each Competitor will be permitted to use additional  drivers during P1 and P2 provided that:  a)  The FIA are informed which cars and drivers each Competitor intends to use in each  session no less than twenty-four (24) hours before the scheduled start of P1. Any changes  less than two (2) hours before the scheduled start of P1 may only be made with the  consent of the stewards.  b)  No more than two (2) drivers are used in any one (1) session.  c)  On two (2) occasions during the Championship, for each car entered for the  Championship, each Competitor must use a driver who has not participated in more than  two (2) Championship races in their career. Each Competitor must advise the FIA in writing  seven (7) days prior to the start of the relevant Competition with the details of the driver  that they will use.  d)  They carry the competition number that has been allocated to them.  e)  They use the power unit and tyres which are allocated to the nominated driver.  f)  They are in possession of a Super Licence or Free Practice Super Licence.  32.5  If one of the Competitor’s nominated drivers is unable to drive at some stage after the end of  initial scrutineering, and the stewards consent to a change of driver, the replacement driver  must use the engine, gearbox and tyres which were allocated to the original driver (see Articles  28.2, 29 and 30.5)."
33)  DRIVING,33.1  The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.
"34)  PIT ENTRY ROAD, PIT LANE AND PIT EXIT ROAD","34.1  Unless otherwise defined by the Race Director, the section of track leading to the pit lane,  between the first safety car line and the beginning of the pit lane, will be designated the “pit  entry road”.  34.2  Unless otherwise defined by the Race Director, the section of track from the end of the pit lane  leading to the track, between the end of the pit lane and the second safety car line, will be  designated the “pit exit road”.  34.3  At no time may a car be reversed in the pit lane under its own power.  34.4  The pit lane will be divided into two lanes, the lane closest to the pit wall will be designated the  “fast lane” and may be no more than 3.5 metres wide, the lane closest to the garages will be  designated the “inner lane”.    Other than when cars are at the end of the pit lane in accordance with Articles 43.3. 44.2 and  57, the inner lane is the only area where any work can be carried out on a car. However, no work  may be carried out in the fast lane if it is likely to hinder other cars attempting to leave the pit  lane.  34.5  The FIA will allocate garages and an area in the pit lane on an equal basis where each Competitor  may work and, within each of these designated garage areas, one position where pit stops  during any free practice session, qualifying session, sprint qualifying session, sprint session or  the race may be carried out. For safety reasons, no car should be driven from its pit stop position  at any time unless:  a)  It has first been driven into the pit stop position having just entered the pit lane from the  track; and  b)  It is then driven immediately back onto the track from the pit stop position.  34.6  No powered device may be used to lift any part of a car in the pit lane.  34.7  A speed limit of 80km/h will be imposed in the pit lane during the whole Competition. However,  this limit may be amended by the Race Director following a recommendation from the Safety  Delegate."
35)  WEIGHING,"35.1  After any free practice session or during the qualifying session or during the sprint qualifying  session cars will be weighed as follows:  a)  When signalled to do so the driver will proceed directly to the FIA garage and stop his  engine.  b)  Any driver who fails to stop when asked to do so, and then fails to bring the car back to  the FIA garage, or if work is carried out on the car before it is returned to the FIA garage,  will be referred to the stewards.  c)  Each driver must be weighed by the Technical Delegate at the end of the last part of the  qualifying session or sprint qualifying session in which they participated.  d)  At the end of the qualifying session or the sprint qualifying session all cars which took part  in Q3 (or SQ3) will be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed, he  must ask the Technical Delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to  that of the car.  e)  If a car stops on the circuit during the qualifying session or the sprint qualifying session  and the driver leaves the car, he must go to the FIA garage immediately on his return to  the pit lane in order for his weight to be established.  35.2  After the sprint session or the race any classified car may be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave  his car before it is weighed, he must ask the Technical Delegate to weigh him in order that this  weight may be added to that of the car.  35.3  The relevant car may be disqualified should its weight be less than that specified in Article 4.1  of the Technical Regulations when weighed in accordance with Articles 35.1 or 35.2, save where  the deficiency in weight results from the accidental loss of a component of the car."
36)  REFUELLING,"36.1  Refuelling is only permitted in the Competitors’ designated garages.  36.2  Fuel may not be added to nor removed from a car after it has left the pit lane to start the  reconnaissance lap(s) permitted in accordance with Articles 43.2 or 44.1 until the end-of-session  signal has been shown in accordance with Article 59.1.  36.3  No car may be refuelled, nor may fuel be removed from a car, at a rate greater than 0.8 litres  per second.  36.4  The driver may remain in his car throughout refuelling but the engine must be stopped.  36.5  During all refuelling or fuel handling operations:    a)  The relevant personnel must be wearing outer garments which are in compliance with  either FIA Standard 8867-2016, FIA Standard 8856-2000 or FIA Standard 8856-2018.    b)  An assistant equipped with a suitable fire extinguisher of appropriate capacity must be  present and must be wearing outer garments which are in compliance with either FIA  Standard 8867-2016, FIA Standard 8856-2000 or FIA Standard 8856-2018.    c)  All cars, refuelling equipment and containers must be suitably grounded where necessary.    d)  Any powered pumping system used to transfer fuel must be operated by a non-latching  switch or be turned off automatically if the operator leaves."
37)  PRACTICE SESSIONS,"37.1  No driver may start a sprint session or the race without taking part in at least one (1) practice  session.  37.2  During all practice sessions there will be a green and a red light at the end of the pit lane. Cars  may only leave the pit lane when the green light is on. Additionally, a blue flag and/or a flashing  blue light will be shown in the pit exit road to warn drivers leaving the pit lane if cars are  approaching on the track.  37.3  Unless written permission has been given by the FIA to do otherwise, the circuit may only be  used for purposes other than the Competition after the last practice session on each day of  practice, after the sprint session (where it is scheduled), and on the day of the race no less than  one (1) hour before the end of the pit lane is opened to allow cars to cover a reconnaissance  lap.  37.4  In the event of a driving infringement during any free practice session, qualifying session or the  sprint qualifying session the Stewards may delete a driver’s lap time (or lap times) or drop the  driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate.   a)  Unless it is completely clear that a driver committed a driving infringement any such  incident will normally be investigated after the relevant session."
38)  FREE PRACTICE,"38.1  At each Competition where a sprint session is scheduled:    a)  One (1) free practice session (P1), lasting one (1) hour will take place on the first day of  on track running.   38.2  At each Competition where a sprint session is not scheduled:  a)  Two (2) free practice sessions (P1 and P2), each lasting one (1) hour and separated by no  less than two (2) hours and no more than three (3) hours, take place on the first day of on  track running.   i)  Within three (3) hours of the end of the second free practice session (P2) all cars  used during each session (or which were intended for use but failed to leave the pit  lane) must be covered and ready for FIA seals to be applied in order to ensure that  they remain secure until the following day. Failure to comply with this requirement  will be equivalent to a breach of Article 23.5g)i) and failure to comply with both  Articles will be considered as a single breach."
39)  QUALIFYING AND SPRINT QUALIFYING SESSIONS,"39.1  The starting grid of the race and the sprint session (if scheduled) will be respectively determined  by the results of the following practice sessions:  a)  The “qualifying session”. This session will take place at the following times:  i)  For Competitions where a sprint session is scheduled: on the second day of track  running, starting no less than three (3) hours, and no more than four (4) hours after  the end of the Sprint.  ii)  For Competitions where a sprint session is not scheduled: on the second day of on  track running, starting no less than two (2) hours, and no more than three (3) hours  after the end of P3."
40)  PRE-SPRINT AND PRE-RACE PARC FERME,"40.1  Each Competitor must provide the Technical Delegate with a suspension set-up sheet for both  of their cars before each of them leaves the pit lane for the first time during the sprint qualifying  session and the qualifying session.  40.2  Each car will be deemed to be in parc fermé from the time at which it leaves the pit lane for the  first time during the sprint qualifying session until the start of the sprint, and from the time at  which it leaves the pit lane for the first time during the qualifying session until the start of the"
41)  VOID,
42)  THE GRID FOR THE SPRINT OR THE RACE,"42.1  The grid for the race will be formed in accordance with the results of the qualifying session  described in Article 39.2, the classification process defined in Article 39.4 and the procedure  defined in Article 42.3. Any penalties received for the race will be added up and be applied using  the procedure defined in Article 42.3.  In the exceptional circumstance that the qualifying session does not take place at a Competition,  and with acceptance of the Stewards that the session cannot take place, the grid for the race  will be defined based upon the Drivers’ Championship classification. In such circumstance, the  procedure defined in Article 42.3 shall be applied using the Drivers’ Championship classification  of each driver instead of their qualifying session classification, all drivers shall be considered to  be classified.  If neither of the methods of forming the grid for the race described above can be applied, the  formation of the grid for the race shall be at the sole discretion of the Stewards.  42.2  The grid for the sprint session, if scheduled, will be formed in accordance with the results of the  sprint qualifying session described in Article 39.3, the classification process defined in Article  39.4 and the procedure defined in Article 42.3. Any penalties received for the sprint session will  be added up and be applied using the procedure defined in Article 42.3.  In the exceptional circumstance that the sprint qualifying session does not take place at a  Competition, and with acceptance of the Stewards that the session cannot take place, the grid  for the sprint will be defined based upon the Drivers’ Championship classification. In such  circumstance, the procedure defined in Article 42.3 shall be applied using the Drivers’"
43)  SPRINT SESSION STARTING PROCEDURE,43.1  The sprint session start procedure detailed below will only be used at those Competitions where  a sprint session is scheduled.
44)  RACE STARTING PROCEDURE,"44.1  Forty (40) minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the pit exit will be opened  and all cars, including any that are required to start the race from the pit lane, will be permitted  to leave the pit lane to cover a reconnaissance lap. Should any driver wish to cover more than  one reconnaissance lap, this must be done by driving down the pit entry road and pit lane at  greatly reduced speed between each of the laps. If a driver stops in his pit between  reconnaissance laps the car may only re-join the track by being driven from the driver’s garage  and not from his pit stop position.    At the end of these laps all cars starting the race from the grid should stop on the grid in starting  order with their engines stopped and all cars required to start the race from the pit lane must  enter the pit lane.    All drivers going to the pit exit at this time must do so at a constant speed and with constant  throttle. This applies over the whole of the pit lane whether a driver is going to the pit exit from  his garage or travelling through the pit lane between reconnaissance laps.    Any car which does not complete a reconnaissance lap and reach the grid under its own power  will not be permitted to start the race from the grid.  44.2  Thirty-two (32) minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap, a warning signal will be  given indicating that the end of the pit lane will be closed in two minutes.    Thirty (30) minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the pit exit will be closed and  a second warning signal will be given.     Any car which is still in the pit lane can start from the end of the pit lane provided it got there  under its own power. If more than one car is affected, they must line up in the order established  under Article 42.3 in which they qualified. However, any car reaching the end of the pit lane  after the five (5) minute signal must start behind any car already at the pit exit.  44.3  The approach of the start will be announced by signals shown ten (10) minutes, five (5) minutes,  three (3) minutes, one (1) minute and fifteen (15) seconds before the start of the formation lap,  each of which will be accompanied by an audible warning.    When the ten (10) minute signal is shown, everybody except drivers, officials and team technical  staff must leave the grid.  44.4  When the five (5) minute signal is shown all cars on the grid and any cars in the pit lane fast lane  must:"
45)  EXTRA FORMATION LAP,"45.1  If at any time after the formation lap has commenced and prior to the start of the sprint session  or race a problem arises that could endanger the start, but that does not necessitate the start  to be aborted (see Article 47), the Race Director may decide an Extra Formation Lap is required,  in such case the following procedures shall apply:  a)   Once all cars starting from the grid, able to do so, have completed the formation lap and  returned to their allocated starting position on the grid, the orange lights on the start  gantry will be illuminated, a board saying “EXTRA FORMATION LAP” will be displayed and  all Competitors will be informed using the official messaging system. After two (2) seconds  the green lights on the start gantry will be illuminated, signalling that all cars able to do  so must leave the grid and complete an extra formation lap.  b)   When leaving the grid to complete the extra formation lap all drivers must respect the pit  lane speed limit until they pass pole position.  c)   Every time this happens the sprint session or the race will be shortened by one (1) lap."
46)  DELAYED START,"46.1  If the Race Director decides the start should be delayed, and the formation lap has not started  the orange abort lights on the start gantry will be illuminated switched on and a board saying  “DELAYED START” will be displayed. The starting procedure will begin again at the ten (10)  minute signal."
47)  ABORTED START,"47.1  If at any time after the formation lap has commenced and prior to the start of the sprint session  or race a problem arises that could endanger the start, the Race Director may decide the start  should be aborted, in such case the following procedures shall apply:  a)  Once all cars able to do so have completed the formation lap and returned to their  allocated position on the grid, the orange lights on the start gantry will be illuminated, a  board saying “ABORTED START” will be displayed, and all Competitors will be informed  using the official messaging system.  b)  All cars starting from the grid should remain in their allocated position on the grid, and all  cars starting from the pit lane should remain in their position in the fast lane. Team  personnel and equipment trolleys will be permitted access to the grid.  All Competitors  will be informed of the likely delay using the official messaging system.   c)  When a new start time is known, all Competitors will be informed using the official  messaging system. The starting procedure will begin again at the ten (10) minute signal,  and will be conducted in accordance with Article 43 for the sprint session or Article 44 for  the race."
48)  FALSE START,"48.1  Any of the penalties under Articles 54.3a), 54.3b), or 54.3c) will be imposed on any driver who  is judged to have:    a)  Moved after the four (4) second light is illuminated and before the start signal is given by  extinguishing all red lights, as defined in Article 44.10 b), or;    b)  Positioned his car on the starting grid in such a way that the transponder is unable to  detect the moment at which the car first moved from its grid position after the start signal  is given, or;    c)  Any part of the contact patch of its front tyres outside of the lines (front and sides) at the  time of the Start signal."
49)  FORMATION LAP(S) BEHIND THE SAFETY CAR,"49.1  If track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the sprint session or the race at the  scheduled time, the formation lap(s) may take place behind the safety car. If this is the case,  and:  a)   If the Race Director deems it necessary to mandate the use of wet-weather tyres, at the  ten (10) minute signal the orange lights of the safety car will be illuminated; this being the  signal to the drivers that the formation lap(s) will take place behind the safety car and the  use of wet-weather tyres as specified under Article 30.5n is compulsory. At the same time  this will be confirmed to all Competitors using the official messaging system.   b)  If the Race Director does not deem it necessary to mandate the use of wet-weather tyres,  at the five (5) minute signal the orange lights of the safety car will be illuminated; this  being the signal to the drivers that the formation lap(s) will take place behind the safety  car. At the same time this will be confirmed to all Competitors using the official messaging  system.  If the formation lap is started behind the safety car, the number of sprint session laps, as  described in Article 5.3a)i), or race laps as described in Article 5.4b, will be reduced by the  number of laps carried out by the safety car minus one.  49.2  When the green lights on the start gantry are illuminated the safety car will leave the grid and  all drivers must follow in grid order, no more than ten (10) car lengths apart, and must respect  the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position. The safety car will continue until conditions  are considered suitable for competition.  49.3  Any cars that were starting the sprint session or the race from the pit lane must join the  formation lap(s) once all cars on track have passed the end of the pit lane for the first time during  the formation lap(s) behind the safety car. Any such cars must complete all formation laps and  must enter the pit lane after the safety car returns to the pits and start the sprint session or the  race from the end of the pit lane in the order they get there."
50)  STARTING PROCEDURE SUSPENDED,"50.1  If at any time after one or more the formation lap(s) behind the safety car (See Article 49) have  commenced, track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the sprint session or the race,  the message “STARTING PROCEDURE SUSPENDED” will be sent to all Competitors using the  official messaging system, red flags will be shown at all marshal posts and at the line, and the  orange lights on the start gantry will be illuminated. and All cars must enter the pit lane behind  the safety car. The procedures described in Articles 57 and 58 must then be followed. The race  will start when the safety car leaves the pit lane as described in Article 58.6."
51)  STANDING START,"51.1  If, after one or more formation laps behind the safety car, the track conditions are considered  suitable to start the sprint session or the race from a standing start, the message “STANDING  START” will be sent to all Competitors via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will  display “SS”, the pit lane exit will be closed, and the car’s orange lights on the safety car will be  extinguished. This will be the signal to the Competitors and drivers that it will be entering the  pit lane at the end of that lap."
52)  ROLLING START,"52.1  If, after one or more formation laps behind the safety car, the track conditions are considered  unsuitable to start the sprint session or the race from a standing start, the message “ROLLING  START” will be sent to all Competitors using the official messaging system, all FIA light panels  will display “RS” , the pit lane exit will be closed, and the car’s orange lights on the safety car will  be extinguished. This will be the signal to the Competitors and drivers that it will be entering the  pit lane at the end of that lap.    At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall  more than ten (10) car lengths behind it.  52.2  As the safety car is approaching the pit entry road the FIA light panels will be extinguished and  a green flag and/or green light panel will be displayed at the Line.  No driver may overtake another car on the track until he passes the Line (see Article 5.3) for the  first time after the safety car has returned to the pits. The sprint session or the race will be  deemed to have started when the leading car crosses the Line after the safety car has returned  to the pits.  In accordance with Article 49.3, cars that were required to start the sprint session or the race  from the pit lane must re-enter the pit lane and may start the sprint session or the race once the  last car has passed the pit exit, and the pit exit is opened, after the start.

53)  SPRINT SESSION AND THE RACE,"53.1  During a sprint session or the race, drivers leaving the pit lane may only do so when the light at  the end of the pit lane is green and on their own responsibility. A marshal with a blue flag and/or  a flashing blue light, will also warn the driver if cars are approaching on the track.  53.2  Except for the circumstances described in Article 26.7d) or Article 57.3, any driver whose car  stops in any area other than the Pit Lane during a sprint session or race and receives physical  assistance resulting in the car re-joining may be disqualified from that sprint session or race."
54)  INCIDENTS DURING THE SPRINT SESSION OR THE RACE,54.1  The Race Director may report any on-track incident or suspected breach of these Sporting  Regulations or the Code (an “Incident”) to the stewards. After review it shall be at the discretion  of the stewards to decide whether or not to proceed with an investigation.
55) SAFETY CAR,"55.1  The FIA safety car will be driven by an FIA appointed safety car driver and will carry an FIA safety  car observer capable of recognising all the competing cars who is in permanent radio contact  with race control.  55.2  Prior to the pit lane opening for a reconnaissance lap, the safety car will leave the pit lane and  take up position at the front of the grid and remain there until the five (5) minute signal is given.  At this point (except under Article 49) it will cover a lap of the track and take up position.  55.3  The safety car may be brought into operation to neutralise a sprint session or a race upon the  order of the clerk of the course. It will be used only if Competitors or officials are in immediate  physical danger on or near the track but the circumstances are not such as to necessitate  suspending the sprint session or the race.  55.4  When the order is given to deploy the safety car the message “SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED” will be  sent to all Competitors via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “SC” and  all marshal’s posts will display waved yellow flags and “SC” boards for the duration of the  intervention.  55.5  No car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed  potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person at any time whilst the safety car is  deployed. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry road,  or the pit lane."
56)  VIRTUAL SAFETY CAR (VSC),"56.1  The VSC procedure may be initiated to neutralise a practice session, sprint session or a race upon  the order of the clerk of the course.  a)  It will normally be used when double waved yellow flags are needed on any section of  track and Competitors or officials may be in danger, but the circumstances are not such  as to warrant use of the safety car itself.  56.2  When the order is given to initiate the VSC procedure a message “VSC DEPLOYED” will be sent  to all Competitors using the official messaging system and all FIA light panels will display “VSC”.  56.3  No car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed  potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person at any time whilst the VSC procedure  is in use. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry road, or  the pit lane.  56.4  When initiated during a sprint session or a race, no car may enter the pits whilst the VSC  procedure is in use unless it is for the purpose of changing tyres.  56.5  All competing cars must reduce speed and stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at  least once in each marshalling sector and at both the first and second safety car lines (a  marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels). All  cars must also be above this minimum time when the FIA light panels change to green (see  Article 56.7 below).    When initiated during the sprint session or a race, the stewards may impose any of the penalties  under Article 54.3a), 54.3b), 54.3c) or 54.3d) on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum  time as required by the above.  56.6  With the exception of the cases listed under a) to d) below, no driver may overtake another car  on the track whilst the VSC procedure is in use.    The exceptions are:    a)  When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track after he has  reached the first safety car line.    b)  When leaving the pits a driver may overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on the track  before he reaches the second safety car line.    c)  Whilst in the pit entry road, pit lane or pit exit road a driver may overtake another car  which is also in one of these three areas.    d)  If any car slows with an obvious problem."
57)  SUSPENDING A SPRINT SESSION OR A RACE,"57.1  If Competitors or officials are placed in immediate physical danger by cars running on the track,  and the clerk of the course deems circumstances are such that the track cannot be negotiated  safely, even behind the safety car, the sprint session or the race will be suspended.    Should it become necessary to suspend the sprint session or the race, the clerk of the course  will order red flags to be shown at all marshal posts and the abort orange lights on the start  gantry to be illuminated shown at the Line.  57.2  When the signal is given overtaking is forbidden, the pit exit will be closed and all cars must  proceed slowly into the pit lane. The first car to arrive in the pit lane should proceed directly to  the pit exit staying in the fast lane, all the other cars should form up in a line behind the first car.  In exceptional circumstances, for reasons of safety the pit entry may be closed before cars have  returned to the pit lane. In such circumstances all cars must proceed slowly to the starting grid,  the first car to arrive on the grid should occupy pole position and others should fill the remaining  grid positions in the order they arrive. The remainder of the procedures detailed in Articles 57.3,  57.4, 57.5 and 58 shall remain unchanged, but will be conducted on the grid instead of in the  fast lane.  57.3  Any cars unable to return to the pit lane as a result of the track being blocked will be brought  back when the track is cleared and will be arranged in the order they occupied before the sprint  session or the race was suspended.    Any cars in the pit lane or pit entry road at the time the sprint session or the race was suspended  will be arranged in the order they occupied before the sprint session or the race was suspended.  Any cars in their garage at the time the sprint session or the race was suspended will be arranged  at the back of the line of cars in the fast lane in the order they got there.     In all cases the order will be taken at the last point at which it was possible to determine the  position of all cars. All such cars will then be permitted to resume the sprint session or the race.    The Safety Car will then be driven to the front of the line of cars in the fast lane.  57.4  Whilst the sprint session or the race is suspended:    a)  The sprint session, the race nor the timekeeping system will stop, however, in accordance  with Article 5.3a)iii) the length of the sprint session suspension or in accordance with  Article 5.4d) the length of the race suspension will be added to the maximum time period.    b)  Cars may be worked on once they have stopped in the fast lane but any such work is  restricted to that listed in Articles 57.4b)i) to x) and must not impede the resumption of  the sprint session or the race.  i)  Starting the engine and any directly associated preparation.  ii)   The addition of compressed gases (see Article 4.5 of the Technical Regulations).  iii)  The fitting or removal of permitted cooling and heating devices.  iv)  Changes to the air ducts around the front and rear brakes."
58)  RESUMING A SPRINT SESSION OR A RACE,"58.1  The delay will be kept as short as possible and as soon as a resumption time is known all  Competitors will be informed via the official messaging system, in all cases at least ten (10)  minutes warning will be given.  If the sprint session or the race is being resumed in wet conditions and the Race Director deems  it necessary, the use of wet-weather tyres as specified under Article 30.5n is compulsory. If this  is the case, at the ten (10) minute signal the orange lights on of the safety car will be illuminated.  At the same time this will be confirmed to all Competitors using the official messaging system.  58.2  Signals will be shown ten minutes, five minutes, three minutes, one minute and fifteen seconds  before the resumption and each of these will be accompanied by an audible warning.  58.3  When the five (5) minute signal is shown, if not already illuminated in accordance with Article  58.1, the orange lights of the safety car will be illuminated. All cars must have their wheels fitted.  Tyre blankets must also be disconnected from any power supply at this time and must not be  reconnected during the start procedure, unless the delayed start signal is shown. After this signal  wheels may only be removed if the car has been moved out of the fast lane or during a further  suspension.    A penalty in accordance with Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have  all its wheels fully fitted at the five (5) minute signal or has any of its wheels changed before it  leaves the pit lane after the sprint session or the race has been resumed.  58.4  At the Two (2) minutes point prior to the resumption any cars between the safety car and the  leader, in addition to any cars that had been lapped by the leader at the time the sprint session  or the race was suspended, will be allowed to leave the pit lane and complete a further lap,  without overtaking, enter the pit lane and then re-join the line of cars behind the safety car.  If track conditions are considered suitable to resume the sprint session or the race from a  standing start, the message “STANDING START PROCEDURE” will be sent to all Competitors.
