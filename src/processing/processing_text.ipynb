This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry road, or  the pit lane.  56.4  When initiated during a sprint session or a race, no car may enter the pits whilst the VSC  procedure is in use unless it is for the purpose of changing tyres.  56.5  All competing cars must reduce speed and stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at  least once in each marshalling sector and at both the first and second safety car lines (a  marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels). All  cars must also be above this minimum time when the FIA light panels change to green (see  Article 56.7 below).    When initiated during the sprint session or a race, the stewards may impose any of the penalties  under Article 54.3a), 54.3b), 54.3c) or 54.3d) on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum  time as required by the above.  56.6  With the exception of the cases listed under a) to d) below, no driver may overtake another car  on the track whilst the VSC procedure is in use.    The exceptions are:    a)  When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track after he has  reached the first safety car line.    b)  When leaving the pits a driver may overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on the track  before he reaches the second safety car line.    c)  Whilst in the pit entry road, pit lane or pit exit road a driver may overtake another car  which is also in one of these three areas.    d)  If any car slows with an obvious problem.'"
